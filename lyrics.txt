[instrumental]

Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ah
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds



And you're gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ah
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking gla** ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ah
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ah
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on
( One)
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head 



Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up, I noticed I was late
( Huh, huh, huh, huh)
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
Ah, ah ah ah
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Ah
Ah, ah ah ah, ah ah ah
I read the news today, oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on
i read the news today oh, boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well i just had to laugh and
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before,
Nobody was really sure if he was from the house of lords.
I saw a film today oh, boy
The english army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But i just had a look
Having read the book,
I'd love to turn you on...



Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up i noticed i was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and i went into a dream
Ah
I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in blackburn, lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all,
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the albert hall.
I'd love to turn you on...





[Speech]
John: This is a Dorsey Burnette number, brother of Johnny Burnette, called "Lonesome Tears in My Eyes," recorded on their very first LP in 1822! *all laugh* Ha!
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right
You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're gonna give me everything
So why on earth should I moan?
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I'll feel okay
When I'm home
Everything seems to be right
When I'm home
Feeling you holding me tight
Tight, yeah
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night 



I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right
Ow!
So why on earth should I moan?
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay
When I'm home
Everything seems to be right
When I'm home
Feeling you holding me tight
Tight, yeah
Ooh, it's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right
You know, I feel all right
You know, I feel all right
It's been a hard day's night, and i been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night, i should be sleeping like a log

1. EXTERIOR STREETS OUTSIDE RAILWAY TERMINAL DAY
The film opens with crowds of girls, shot in a sequence of CLOSE-UPS, chasing after GEORGE, JOHN and RINGO. The boys hare off just ahead of them. They take a turn down a back alley way and the crowds of screaming girls are after them.
2. EXT. TERMINAL
They rush on through the narrow cobbled pa**ageway and into the main station, quickly show their tickets at the barrier for the London train, and get onto the platform as hordes of yelling and screaming girls reach the closed gates.
3. EXT. TERMINAL PLATFORM
We see the fans rushing to the few platform ticket machines, and endless pennies being dropped and tickets torn out in their haste to get onto the platform to see the boys.
NORM has been waiting for the boys and he hurries them to where all their baggage, instruments and the drums are waiting, piled up to be put into the guards' van. The boys turn and see the oncoming stream of girls pushing through the barriers and descending on them with yells and shouts. They grab their instruments, RINGO makes for the drums. NORM plugs into a handy transformer and using their instruments like a gun volley to stop the onrush of females, the boys blast fire into a number and start to sing. This stops the girls in their tracks and they settle down on whatever they can to listen to them playing.
As the boys are playing, we CUT BACK into the crowds. In the centre we see PAUL struggling and pulling to fight his way through the girls to join the other boys. He is dragging a very reluctant old man behind him. The old man seems most disgruntled and we can see by his gestures how unwilling he is to be pulled and pushed forward through all the girls.
At last PAUL reaches the other boys. He sits the old man down on a pile of cases and joins in the number to the squeals of delight from the fans. The old man sits aloof and proud ignoring the whole proceedings. JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO look enquiringly at PAUL who gives a noncommittal shrug of the shoulders as if to say, "it's not my fault" and the number proceeds.
SHOT of sudden horror on JOHN's face. PAUL follows his eye line only to see the old man has doffed his cap and is busily collecting money from a disconcerted crowd. PAUL dives hastily into the crowd, and with suitable apologies extracts the old man and with a long suffering sigh drags him back to the group. GEORGE and PAUL hold him firmly as they finish the number, the old man standing there between them.
As the number finishes and the girls scream and shout with delight, the guard blows his whistle. NORM and SHAKE grab the instruments and the drums, and with the rest piles the lot into the guards' van. The BOYS head into their reserved compartment pursued by the fans but the train moves off. They have successfully repelled all extra boarders.
THE BOYS stand and wave to the fans until out of sight line ... the girls running along to the end of the platform waving and calling out.
4. INTERIOR RESERVED COMPARTMENT IN THE TRAIN
The boys relax, sitting down on one side of the compartment. They are about to settle down and make themselves at home when first RINGO nudges GEORGE who in turn nudges JOHN. Opposite them is sitting the LITTLE OLD MAN. He is holding himself stiff, erect and very aloof.
The three boys look at him enquiringly but with an elaborate sniff he looks away from them and out of the window.
PAUL catches his eye and winks at the LITTLE OLD MAN. He winks back at PAUL, scowls at the other three then looks firmly out of the window again.
The boys turn on PAUL crowding around him.
JOHN
Eh ... pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?
PAUL
What little old man?
JOHN
(pointing)
That little old man.
PAUL
Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.
GEORGE
That's not your Grandfather.
PAUL
It is, y'know.
GEORGE
But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.
PAUL
Oh, that's me other Grandfather, but this one's me Grandfather and all.
JOHN
How d'you reckon that one out?
PAUL
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
JOHN
(long suffering)
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
PAUL
Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.
RINGO
How's that?
PAUL
Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
The lads all look intently at the GRANDFATHER.
JOHN
Aah ... the poor old thing.
He leans across to GRANDFATHER.
JOHN
Eh, Mister... are you nursing a broken heart then?
The GRANDFATHER nods soulfully glares at him, in a way that indicates yes.
PAUL
(whispering)
You see, he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher.
GEORGE
A butcher?
PAUL
Yeah, she was fickle.
JOHN
Aye and fond of fresh meat and all.
PAUL
(seriously)
No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.
JOHN
Oh, I see.
He inspects GRANDFATHER carefully.
JOHN
(to PAUL)
Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?
PAUL
Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
They all agree with PAUL.
JOHN has been examining GRANDFATHER. He now leans forward to him.
JOHN
(in an over-friendly voice)
Hello, Grandfather!
GRANDFATHER
Hello.
JOHN
(delightedly)
He can talk then?
PAUL
(indignantly)
Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?
RINGO
(grinning)
Well ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?
The lads all laugh.
JOHN
And we're looking after him, are we?
GRANDFATHER
I'll look after meself.
PAUL
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
JOHN
He's got you worried, then?
PAUL
Him, he costs you a fortune in breach-of-promise cases. He's a villain and a right mixer as well.
GEORGE
(disbelieving)
Gerron.
PAUL
No, straight up.
GRANDFATHER
The lad's given you the simple truth. I'm cursed wid irresistible charm, I'm too attractive to be let loose.
At this moment, SHAKE, a tall man who works with the BOYS, pulls open the door of the compartment.
SHAKE
You got on all right then?
BOYS
Hi, Shake.
SHAKE
We're here. Norm'll be along in a mo' with the tickets.
He sees GRANDFATHER.
SHAKE
Morning!
(whispers)
Who's that little old man?
GEORGE
It's Paul's grandfather.
SHAKE
Oh aye, but I thought ...
JOHN
(cutting in)
No, that's his other one.
SHAKE
That's all right then.
JOHN
(displaying Grandfather)
Clean though, isn't he?
SHAKE
Oh yes, he's clean all right.
NORM the road manager appears behind SHAKE.
NORM
Morning, lads.
BOYS
Morning ... Hi, Norm.
NORM
(checking them quickly)
Well, thank God you're all got here. Now, listen, I've had this marvellous idea ... now just for a change, let's all behave like ordinary responsible citizens. Let's not cause any trouble, pull any strokes or do anything I'm going to be sorry for, especially tomorrow at the television theatre, because ...
He looks sharply at JOHN who is polishing his nails.
NORM
Are you listening to me, Lennon?
JOHN
(off-hand)
You're a swine, isn't he George?
GEORGE
(disinterested)
Yeah ... a swine.
NORM
(just as indifferent)
Thanks...
He sees the GRANDFATHER.
NORM
Eh ... .
BOYS IN CHORUS
... Who's that little old man?
NORM
Well, who is he?
RINGO
He belongs to Paul.
NORM
(accepting the situation)
Ah well, there you go. Look, I'm going down the diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming?
PAUL
We'll follow you down.
GRANDFATHER rises.
GRANDFATHER
I want me coffee.
NORM
He can come with Shake and me if you like.
PAUL
Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.
NORM
Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.
GRANDFATHER joins SHAKE and NORM.
NORM
(over Grandfather's head)
He's very clean, isn't he?
SHAKE and NORM collect GRANDFATHER and are in the process of leaving the compartment when a fat upper cla** city Englishman, JOHNSON, attempts to enter. There is a bit of confusion and they get tangled up with each other.
JOHNSON
Make up your minds, will you!
At last SHAKE, NORM and GRANDFATHER sort themselves out and JOHNSON enters with his case. The other three go to coffee.
JOHNSON puts his case up on the luggage rack, then sits down. All his movements are disgruntled ... he finally picks up his copy of the Financial Times and burying himself behind it, starts to read. After a moment he looks up, notices the compartment window is open. He gets up and without so much as a "by your leave" he closes it, glares at the BOYS and sits down again.
The boys exchange looks as if to say ... "Hello, Saucy!!"
PAUL
(politely)
Do you mind if we have it opened?
JOHNSON
(briefly)
Yes, I do.
JOHN
Yeah, but there are four of us, like, and we'd like it open, if it's all the same to you, that is.
JOHNSON
(rudely)
Well, it isn't. I travel on this train regularly twice a week, so I suppose I've some rights.
RINGO
Aye, well, so have we.
He disappears behind his paper before the BOYS can say another word.
RINGO pulls a face at the raised paper and switches on his portable radio. A pop number is playing.
JOHNSON puts down his paper firmly.
JOHNSON
And we'll have that thing off as well, thank you.
RINGO
But I ...
JOHNSON leans over and switches it off.
JOHNSON
An elementary knowledge of the Railway Acts would tell you I'm perfectly within my rights.
He smiles frostily.
PAUL
Yeah, but we want to hear it and there's more of us than you. We're a community, like, a majority vote. Up the workers and all that stuff!
JOHNSON
Then I suggest you take that damned thing into the corridor or some other part of the train where you obviously belong.
JOHN
(leaning forward to him)
Gie's a kiss!
PAUL
Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.
JOHNSON
I travel on this train regularly, twice a week.
JOHN
Knock it off, Paul, y' can't win with his sort. After all, it's his train, isn't it, Mister?
JOHNSON
And don't you take that tone with me, young man!
GEORGE
But...
JOHNSON
(accusingly)
I fought the war for your sort.
RINGO
Bet you're sorry you won!
JOHNSON
I'll call the guard!
PAUL
Aye ... but what? They don't take kindly to insults you know. Ah, come on, you lot. Let's get a cup of coffee and leave Toby the manger.
The boys troop out of the door into the corridor. JOHNSON smiles triumphantly. He is about to settle down to his paper when there is a tap on the corridor window. He looks up and we see pressed against the window a collection of hideous Beatle faces.
PAUL
Eh, Mister ... can we have our ball back!
The man jumps to his feet.
5. INTERIOR OF THE CORRIDOR
The boys run away like a pack of school boys and disappear round the corner.
6. INTERIOR OF THE TRAIN CORRIDOR
From the P.O.V. of the door leading to the restaurant car.
The boys come down the corridor in full flight, laughing away like happy idiots. GEORGE and PAUL pull open the sliding doors. The boys look inside.
7. INTERIOR RESTAURANT CAR
From their P.O.V. we see the car is half empty and at a table in the centre SHAKE and NORM and GRANDFATHER are sitting. On the table is a pile of photos of the boys. NORM and SHAKE are arguing. NORM is being very aggressive, much to SHAKE's discomfort.
NORM
Yeah, you want to watch it.
SHAKE
(unhappily)
It's not my fault.
NORM
Well, you stick to that story, son.
SHAKE
I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.
GRANDFATHER
(To NORM slyly)
They always say that.
NORM
Yeah, well I got me eye on you.
SHAKE
I'm sorry Norm, but I can't help being taller
than you.
NORM
Well, you don't have to rub me nose in it. I've a good mind to ...
(he is about to thump SHAKE.)
JOHN
(enjoying himself)
If you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats.
NORM
He started it.
SHAKE
No, I didn't you did ...
GEORGE
Well, what happened?
SHAKE
The old fella wanted these pictures and Norm said he couldn't have 'em, all I said was 'aw go on, be big about it.'
PAUL
And?
NORM
Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.
PAUL
I knew it, he started it, I should have known.
NORM
Y'what?
PAUL
You two have never had a quarrel in your life and in two minutes flat he's got you at it. He's a king mixer. Adam and Eve, meet the serpent. Anthony and Cleopatra, there's your asp. Divide and Conquer, that's this one's motto. He hates group unity so he gets everyone at it.
The BOYS, i.e., JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO, look at each other then at PAUL.
PAUL
Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.
GEORGE
I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.
NORM
You're right. Here you are, old devil.
SHAKE and NORM leave. GRANDFATHER grins triumphantly and collects them, then with a sweet smile he turns to PAUL.
GRANDFATHER
Would you ever sign this one for us, Pauly?
PAUL does so automatically but in the middle of signing he gets suspicious. GRANDFATHER smiles at him charmingly so PAUL finishes signing.
JOHN
Come on let's get this coffee.
GRANDFATHER
Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!
JOHN, RINGO and GEORGE take this up straight away. They all pretend to be girls, RINGO jumps into PAUL's arms.
GEORGE
(coyly)
Oh, Paul, you can't have your own way!!!
JOHN
(invitingly, in a Marlene Dietrich voice)
If I let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me?
PAUL
(choked)
I'll murder you, Grandfather!
JOHN waltzes PAUL down to an empty table and the lads sit down.
GEORGE
Eh, look at that talent.
They all gaze across the aisle. From their P.O.V. we see two very attractive young girls, RITA and JEAN, having coffee.
JOHN
Give 'em a pull.
PAUL
Shall I?
GEORGE
Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
PAUL
Now what's that supposed to mean?
GEORGE
(grinning)
I don't really know, but it sounded distinguished, like, didn't it?
JOHN
George Harrison, The Scouse of Distinction.
We follow PAUL as he crosses over to the two girls. He places a bowler on his head.
PAUL
(in posh accent)
Excuse me, but these young men I'm sitting with wondered if two of us could join you; I'd ask you meself only I'm shy.
The two girls giggle together.
JOHN and GEORGE are about to move over when GRANDFATHER suddenly appears by their sides.
GRANDFATHER
(sternly)
I'm sorry, miss, but you mustn't fraternise with my prisoners.
JEAN
Prisoners!!
GRANDFATHER
Convicts in transit to Wormwood Scrubs. Typical old lags, the lot of 'em.
THE BOYS
Y'what!!!
GRANDFATHER
Quiet, you lot, or I'll give you a touch of me truncheon.
(He points at Ringo)
That little one's the worst. If we don't keep him on tablets he has fits.
RINGO
(protesting)
Now look here!!
GRANDFATHER grabs two lumps of sugar from the table and forces them into RINGO'S mouth.
GRANDFATHER
Get out while you can, ladies, his time's
coming round for one of his turns.
The frightened girls scurry out of the restaurant car. The boys look in amazement and horror at GRANDFATHER. They are completely flabbergasted. GRANDFATHER smiles at them benignly.
8. INTERIOR OF RAILWAY COMPARTMENT
SHAKE and NORM are seated. SHAKE is buried in a science fiction book.
NORM looks at his watch, slightly worried.
NORM
He's been gone a long time.
SHAKE
(without looking up)
Who?
NORM
Paul's grandfather.
SHAKE
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
NORM
Down the ... er ...
SHAKE
Oh, down the ... er ...?
NORM
Yeah, down the ... er ...
SHAKE
Well, give a couple of minutes ...
He resumes reading. But NORM goes on worrying.
9. INTERIOR OF ANOTHER RAILWAY COMPARTMENT
Grandfather is in full flight of conversation with a charming elderly lady, AUDREY, who is listening intently.
GRANDFATHER
(proudly)
Yes, I'm their manager, I discovered them.
LADY AUDREY
Did you indeed, Mr. McCartney?
GRANDFATHER
Now, Audrey, I told you, the name's John. We show biz people are a friendly lot.
AUDREY
Of course, John.
GRANDFATHER
Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. "Mister, can you spare us a copper?" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner.
AUDREY
The usual ten per cent?
GRANDFATHER
Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
AUDREY
(her eyes lighting up)
How fascinating. Do go on ...
(pause)
... John.
GRANDFATHER
... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ...
10. INTERIOR CORRIDOR OF TRAIN
NORM and SHAKE meet with the BOYS as they are returning from coffee.
NORM
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?
JOHN
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
NORM
No ... he's must have slipped off somewhere.
PAUL
(accusingly)
Have you lost him?
NORM
Don't exaggerate.
PAUL
You've lost him.
SHAKE
Put it this way, he's mislaid him.
PAUL
You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
SHAKE
He can't be far.
JOHN
I hope he fell off.
PAUL
(mildly)
Don't be callous.
RINGO
He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.
GEORGE
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
RINGO
Yeah, I know, that's why I took up the drums. It's me active compensatory factor.
JOHN and PAUL run down the corridor. SHAKE and NORM turn from the door and go in the opposite direction, GEORGE and RINGO follow after the other two boys.
11. INTERIOR CORRIDOR OF TRAIN
PAUL and JOHN look into various compartments. CLOSE SHOT of RINGO looking into compartments in the manner of Groucho Marx. In one of the compartments we see from RINGO'S P.O.V. the occupant, a glamorous woman, TANIA, with a small lap dog.
She is beautifully and most expensively dressed. She looks up and sees RINGO.
RINGO smiles at her and she smiles back. She then beckons him to join her.
He looks around to see if she means someone else. She nods a negative. RINGO looks back enquiringly then points at himself as if to say: "Who, me?"
TANIA smiles enthusiastically.
GEORGE has been watching all this.
GEORGE
Are you going in?
RINGO
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
GEORGE
You never know, you might be lucky this time.
RINGO
No, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.
He blows the glamorous lady a kiss, then moves sadly on.
12. INTERIOR FURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR
PAUL enters a compartment followed by JOHN. The TWO GIRLS, RITA and JEAN, from the restaurant car are sitting there.
PAUL
Excuse me but have you seen that little old man we were with?

The girls jump up, surprised.
JOHN
We've broken out, oh, the blessed freedom of it all!
(he extends his hands as if handcuffed)
Eh, have you got a nail file, these handcuffs are k**ing me. I was framed. I was innocent.
PAUL
Will you stop it! Sorry to disturb you, miss...
He starts to drag JOHN after him.
JOHN
I was innocent. I was framed. I won't go back.
JOHN is now by the door; he leers at the girls horribly.
JOHN
I bet you can guess what I was in for.
He cackles like a maniac before disappearing, the door closing after him.
A waiter carrying a tray with champagne and gla**es on it pa**es into one of the compartments with the blinds down.
PAUL
How about that one?
He moves towards the compartment.
PAUL
(to Ringo and George)
Did you look in here?
GEORGE
No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
PAUL
Well, let's broaden our outlook.
PAUL opens the door of the compartment.
13. INTERIOR OF COMPARTMENT
From the BOYS' P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER and the elderly lady, AUDREY, sipping champagne and nibbling caviar on toast.
GRANDFATHER
(looking up)
Congratulate me, boys, I'm engaged.
PAUL enters and crosses over to him.
PAUL
Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?
GRANDFATHER
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
PAUL
Oh, well that's all right.
(realising)
What?
AUDREY
Young man, kindly moderate your tone when you address my fiance.
PAUL
I'm sorry, Missus, but the betrothal's off.
(He grabs GRANDFATHER by the arm.)
I'll refuse me consent, he's over-age!
AUDREY grabs GRANDFATHER's other arm and pulls back.
AUDREY
Leave him alone, after all he's done for you is this the way you repay him?
A tug of war now starts between PAUL and AUDREY.
PAUL
(pulling)
Him? he's never done anything for anybody in his life.
AUDREY
(pulling)
You dare to say that when even those ridiculous clothes you are wearing were bought when you forced him to sell out his gilt edged Indomitables!!
JOHN and GEORGE jump on the seat egging PAUL and AUDREY on.
JOHN
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
GEORGE
Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
RINGO attempts to interfere.
RINGO
Look, Missus, this is all a misunderstanding, you see, he's ...
AUDREY
Keep away from me, you depraved lout, I know all about your terrible past.
RINGO
Y'what?
She hits RINGO with her handbag and continues struggling with PAUL for GRANDFATHER. RINGO grabs her handbag to stop her hitting him.
RINGO
He's given me a bad character, blackguarding me name to all and sundry. He's got to be stopped. It's not fair.
RINGO pushes out into the corridor, forgetting that he is holding the woman's handbag.
A voice shouts off from outside.
VOICE OFF
That's one of them ... stop thief!
14. INTERIOR CORRIDOR
From Ringo's P.O.V. we see down to the right the city man, JOHNSON, approaching with a GUARD. RINGO turns the other way to the left when he is joined by [the] three other boys. From their P.O.V. down the corridor we see the two girls, autograph books in hand, followed by ten girls from the same school.
Both groups are closing in on the BOYS. There's no escape.
RINGO
(looking down at the handbag in his hand)
Oh Mother!!
15. INTERIOR LUGGAGE VAN
Very dark, and behind bars we see GRANDFATHER. He is sitting crouched up on a wooden box tea chest and looks pretty miserable. He turns towards the CAMERA; in the foreground of the SHOT we see PAUL standing.
In the background an impa**ive GUARD is reading a paper which he does throughout the scene.
GRANDFATHER
(bitterly)
And to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars!
PAUL
Don't dramatise.
The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see GRANDFATHER in the luggage compartment of the guards' van. In with him are a crate of chickens and a dog. The chickens peck at him; GRANDFATHER moves listlessly away.
PAUL
Let's face it, you're lucky to be here. If they'd have had their way you'd have been dropped off at Stafford already.
GRANDFATHER proudly turns away from PAUL who dodges round so he can still see his face.
PAUL
Well, you've got to admit you've upset a lot of people. At least I can keep my eye on you while you're stuck in here.
GRANDFATHER turns away again.
PAUL
All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
GRANDFATHER
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
PAUL
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to d**h! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
GRANDFATHER
(cutting in)
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
PAUL
Yeah ... so what?
GRANDFATHER
Why do you always use your left hand?
PAUL
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
GRANDFATHER
And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.
PAUL grins. After a moment of looking at him, PAUL opens the door of
the luggage compartment and joins GRANDFATHER on a box.
PAUL
Shove up!
GRANDFATHER produces a penny.
GRANDFATHER
Odds or evens?
PAUL sighs.
PAUL
Odds.
GRANDFATHER flips the coin.
The guards' van door opens and JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO come in, with them are the girls, RITA and JEAN.
JOHN
(as he sees PAUL behind the bars)
Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
PAUL
Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.
(to Ringo)
Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
RINGO
Me? Why?
GEORGE
Bag-snatcher.
GRANDFATHER
That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.
JOHN
(casually)
Every morning.
JOHN has been looking around the guards' van.
JOHN
Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny...
(he pats the dog)
'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial.
(he shudders)
Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.
PAUL
Like what?
JOHN
Well, I've got me gob stopper.
(he produces his mouth organ.)
Look, a genuine Stradivarius, hand tooled at Dagenham.
And to RINGO's beat on a tea chest they are off, PAUL and GEORGE improvising other sounds, much to the GIRLS' delight. During the number, GRANDFATHER quietly lets the latch off the chicken crate and chickens begin to wander through the scene.
16. EXTERIOR TRAIN IN MOTION FROM ABOVE (NIGHT)
While the number is progressing, the train is getting nearer and nearer to London.
17. EXTERIOR PLATFORM TERMINUS (NIGHT)
SHOTS of the station full of GIRLS waiting for the BOYS.
18. INTERIOR GUARDS VAN
By the time the number finishes the train pulls up with a sharp halt that sends them all sprawling, BOYS and GIRLS.
NORM enters the guards' van.
NORM
Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.
JOHN
Please, can I have one to surge with?
NORM
No.
JOHN
Ah, go on, you swine.
NORM
No, you can't. Look, as soon as I tell you, run through this door here and into the big car that's waiting.
He points and we see a big car parked across the road.
The BOYS prepare to depart, lining up with GRANDFATHER at the door.
19. EXTERIOR PLATFORM TERMINUS
Just as they are ready to go, a line of taxis draws up parallel to the train and now separates them from the big car waiting for them.
NORM
Oh no!
GRANDFATHER pushes past the BOYS, holding his coat closed.
GRANDFATHER
All right, lads, follow me.
And before NORM can stop him, he darts out of the door, PAUL after him. The fans further down the platform see PAUL and charge forward ... in a panic NORM and the others follow, JOHN just having time to kiss both the girls.
JOHN
Vive l'amour!
NORM drags him away.
20. EXTERIOR RAILWAY STATION
The BOYS manage to follow GRANDFATHER by leaping onto a motorized luggage carrier, GEORGE driving and the other three posing as a frozen tableau on the back. GRANDFATHER has arrived at a taxi door. He flings it open and runs through, opening the other door, thus making a safe bridge to the car.
The BOYS follow and manage to make it to the big car safely. They run towards grandfather's taxi. The FANS have followed the BOYS and we see streams of GIRLS piling through all the taxis one of which contains JOHNSON the city man, opening and shutting the doors to get through, much to the indignation of the TAXI DRIVERS.
21. INTERIOR BIG CAR
NORM is sitting in front with the driver, FRANK. The four BOYS and GRANDFATHER are squashed together in the back.
NORM
(to the driver)
Go like the clappers, son!
FRANK
(smoothly)
That was my entire intention, sir.
22. EXTERIOR STATION
The car moves off surrounded by the FANS; from a height we see them converge on the car but it moves forcefully out of the station and off.
It moves into the traffic in the main road and the journey to the hotel begins.
23. INTERIOR HOTEL SUITE NIGHT
There is a reception room and off it lead rooms that are presumably bedrooms, bathroom, etc. JOHN is lying sprawled out on a settee listening to a transistor radio, demolishing a basket of fruit. PAUL is sitting at an upright piano and GRANDFATHER is mooching about the room. One of the doors opens and GEORGE enters followed by RINGO, none of the BOYS are wearing coats.
RINGO
I don't snore.
GEORGE
You do - repeatedly.
RINGO
(to John)
Do I snore?
JOHN
(eating a banana)
You're a window rattler, son.
RINGO
Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?
PAUL
(stopping playing)
With a trombone hooter like yours it'd be unnatural if you didn't.
GRANDFATHER
Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
PAUL
Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
GRANDFATHER
Well, it may be a joke, but it's his nose. He can't help having a horrible great nose, it's the only one he's got. And his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it.
NORM enters with three piles of fan mail and places them in front of JOHN on a table. RINGO is almost in tears, examining his nose in a mirror.
NORM
Paul, John, George - get at it.
JOHN
Hello the income tax have caught up with us at last.
PAUL and GEORGE gather round the low table. RINGO is left out of it.
RINGO
None for me, then?
NORM
Sorry.
John hands RINGO a single envelope.
JOHN
That'll keep you busy.
GRANDFATHER
It's your nose, y'see. Fans are funny that way. Take a dislike to things. They'll pick on a nose...
RINGO
You go and pick on your own.
SHAKE enters with a stack of mail about three times larger than all the others put together.
JOHN
Is that yours?
SHAKE
For Ringo.
He dumps it in Ringo's arms who staggers into an armchair. The BOYS send him up.
JOHN
That must have cost you a fortune in stamps, Ringo.
GEORGE
He comes from a large family.
RINGO
(dumping the letters)
Well.
RINGO opens his letter and reads it. It contains a large embossed card.
RINGO
Eh, what's Boyd's Club?
The lads gather round him and PAUL takes the card from him and reads.
PAUL
"The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr Richard Starkey"--that's you--"in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet." Blimey!
RINGO
(surprised)
And they want me?
JOHN
Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.
NORM
(snatching the card)
Well you're not going.
RINGO
Ah.
GRANDFATHER
(taking card from Norm)
Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!
He pockets the card himself.
RINGO
That's mine.
NORM
Have done, and you lot get your pens out.
BOYS
Why?
NORM
It's homework time for all you college puddings. I want this lot
(he indicates the fan letters)
all answered tonight.
The BOYS all protest.
NORM
I'll brook no denial!
JOHN
It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
NORM
Come on, Shake, we'll leave 'em to their
penmanship.
He goes followed by SHAKE.
There is a pause and JOHN deliberately rises slowly and crosses to his coat. He puts it on and walks to the door.
JOHN
While the swine's away the piglets can play. Well, come on, what are we waiting for?
With a whoop PAUL, GEORGE and RINGO collect their coats and head for the door.
GRANDFATHER
What about all these letters?
BOYS
Read 'em!
They disappear. After a moment GRANDFATHER takes out Ringo's card.
C.U. GRANDFATHER
GRANDFATHER
And a free champagne buffet.
He grins to himself. At this moment a WAITER enters with a tray. He is clad in tails and GRANDFATHER eyes them longingly, measuring himself the while alongside the startled waiter. He leaves us with no doubt in our minds what he wants, i.e., the waiter's suit.
24. INTERIOR DANCING CLUB NIGHT
The club is the latest in modern decor and full of teenagers all enjoying themselves. The CAMERA wanders around the club till it finally picks out JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE and RINGO all crowded around one small table. The music is blaring away from a juke box and the BOYS join the dancers. They are recognised and given smiles and nods of encouragement
by all the other customers. During this scene we
CUT AWAY
25. INTERIOR BOYD'S CLUB NIGHT
The whole atmosphere is of quiet elegance and loud wealth. Around the baccarat table the rich, bored customers sit barely moving a face muscle as they languidly murmur "suivez" and "banco" to the dealer as he operates the shoe. The manager of the club is beaming with satisfaction as he surveys his customers. One of these customers is clad in evening dress and he has his back to us. The rest of the players (male) are in suits. By each of them is standing a lush lady with a bored sophisticated face that looks as if it has been painted on. From the REVERSE of the LAST SHOT we now see the solitary evening dress player is GRANDFATHER. He looks around him and wipes off his look of enjoyment and elaborately out-bores everyone in the room.
DEALER
Alors, M'sieur?
GRANDFATHER
(nonchalant)
Souflée.
He turns to the buxom BLONDE, who is dripping over him.
GRANDFATHER
I bet you're a great swimmer. My turn? Bingo!
CROUPIER
Pas "Bingo," M'sieur... Banco.
GRANDFATHER
(taking)
I'll take the little darlings anyway.
He takes up the cards and can't understand that they are unnumbered.
GRANDFATHER
Two and one is three, carry one is four.
The buxom BLONDE leans over him.
BLONDE
Lay them down.
GRANDFATHER
(disturbed by his eyeline)
Eh?
BLONDE
Lay them down.
GRANDFATHER
We'd be thrown out.
BLONDE
Your cards... lay them down... face up.
He does so.
CROUPIER
Huit à la pointe... et sept.
(He pushes chips and box to Grandfather.)
BLONDE
You had a lovely little pair, y'see.
GRANDFATHER
I did?
CROUPIER taps impatiently on box (shoe).
BLONDE
They're yours.
GRANDFATHER
They are?
BLONDE
The cards... you're bank.
26. INTERIOR DANCING CLUB
The BOYS are having a rare old time and the place is really moving.
27. INTERIOR BOYD'S CLUB
GRANDFATHER is playing and a waiter is checking the requirements of the players.
GRANDFATHER
Bingo!
CROUPIER
(wearily)
M'lord dit "Bingo."
WAITER
(to Grandfather)
A little light refreshment.
GRANDFATHER
(lordly)
A gla** of the old chablis to wash down a gesture of giblets wouldn't go amiss.
(He resumes his game.)
Souflée, chop chop.
The CROUPIER uses the spatula to pick up a card. GRANDFATHER grabs it and scoops some sandwiches off a pa**ing tray.
28. INTERIOR DANCING CLUB
The BOYS are at their table again laughing and enjoying themselves, when suddenly their faces freeze.
From their P.O.V. we see NORM standing glowering down at them. With him is SHAKE. Reluctantly the BOYS arise and follow NORM out.
29. INTERIOR BOYD'S
GRANDFATHER is looking worried at the call of the card he loses and we see that all his chips have gone. He notices the waiter delivering snacks and champagne to a couple, so quick as a flash, he places a handkerchief over his arm and writing a bill out on a piece of paper, presents it to the couple and collects payment in chips. He then resumes playing.
30. INTERIOR HOTEL ROOM
Waiter is sitting on chair in underclothes, reading. He hears a noise, says "The manager!" and hides in outer clothes closet. NORM and the BOYS enter saying:
NORM
Now get on with it.
JOHN
We were going to do it.
NORM
Aye, well, now!
(He goes through bedroom.)
RINGO goes to hang up coat in closet. He does so, then crosses to rest.
RINGO
Any of you lot put a man in that cupboard?
ALL
A man? No.
RINGO
Well somebody did.
GEORGE goes to cupboard. We see the WAITER from his P.O.V. He closes door, returns to group.
GEORGE
He's right, y'know.
BOYS
(disinterested)
Ah well, there you go.
SHAKE enters front door, goes to hang up coat and drags WAITER out.
SHAKE
Eh, what's all this?
PAUL
Oh, him... He's been lurking.
JOHN
Aye, he looks a right lurker.
SHAKE
(to WAITER)
You're undressed. Where are your clothes?
WAITER
The old gentlemen borrowed them to go gambling at Boyd's.
PAUL
No!
RINGO
Oh, he's gone to my club, has he?
PAUL
(turning on Ringo)
Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.
JOHN
Well, what are we waiting for?
SHAKE
Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours
is worse than any of you lot.
31. INTERIOR BOYD'S
GRANDFATHER is drinking champagne in locked arms with BLONDE.
WAITER
Encore de champagne, Monsieur?
GRANDFATHER
Yes, and I'll have some more champagne as well.
He takes another swig of his gla**.
MANAGER
(beaming)
Lord John McCartney, he's the millionaire Irish Peer, filthy rich of course.
CUSTOMER
Oh I don't know, looks rather clean to me.
The MANAGER comes to grandfather's side.
MANAGER
Play is about to resume, m'lord.
GRANDFATHER
(handing him a chip)
Lead me to it, I've a winning itch that only success can pacify.
He takes his place at the table. The MANAGER watches for a moment then moves away from the table towards the club reception desk.
32. INTERIOR RECEPTION DESK BOYD'S CLUB
JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO, NORM and SHAKE are trying to gain entrance.
ATTENDANT
I'm sorry sir, members and invited guests only.
PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO, JOHN
I've got to get in.
It's urgent and important.
I've had an invite.
Take me to your leader.
NORM
Shurrup.
The BOYS do and meanwhile the MANAGER has walked into SHOT. He recognises the BOYS and welcomes them with false enthusiasm. They all start to enter the main room.
NORM
All we want to know is have you got a little
old man in there?
MANAGER
(pleasantly)
Do you mean Lord McCartney?
CLOSE-UP PAUL
PAUL
He's at it again. Look, I'm his grandfather... I mean...
BLONDE
(standing next to Grandfather)
Oh, it must be the dolly floor show.
JOHN
Stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.
GRANDFATHER
Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ... (etc.)
They grab the protesting GRANDFATHER and drag him into the reception area. He keeps trying to return to BLONDE and table. GEORGE and RINGO each take an end of the velvet cord hanging between the two stanchions. They exchange ends and re-hook it, thus encircling GRANDFATHER by the
entrance desk. They then go to settle up.
MANAGER
(with false charm)
Before you go, gentlemen, there's the small matter of the bill.
He snaps his fingers and a waiter hands him the bill.
NORM
(taking it)
I'll settle that.
He glances at it.
NORM
A hundred and eighty pounds!
MANAGER
(icily)
I beg your pardon, guineas.
At that moment a WAITER appears with a tray full of pound notes.
WAITER
Your winnings, my lord, one hundred and ninety
pounds.
The MANAGER tears up the bill and takes the money.
GRANDFATHER
How about me change?
MANAGER
Cloak room charge.
He hands GRANDFATHER his old mackintosh.
RINGO
(brightly)
Ah well, easy come, easy go.
The others glower at him.
RINGO
Well.
33. INTERIOR BIG CAR (MOVING ON WAY TO STUDIOS)
The BOYS have settled down.
JOHN
Should I say it?
GEORGE
Follow your impulse.
RINGO
It'll only get you into trouble.
JOHN
(to RINGO)
Aah, shurrup, misery!
JOHN slouches forward.
JOHN
(urgently)
O.K. Driver, follow that car!!
The driver [Frank] is an urbane young man in a handsome grey uniform.
FRANK
(indicating the traffic)
Would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
JOHN
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
FRANK
Sorry?
(meaning: "I beg your pardon.")
GEORGE
Oh, don't pay any attention to him, he was just fulfilling a lifelong ambition.
FRANK
I see.
JOHN
Yeah, you know, "O.K. Buster, follow that car, there's a sawbuck in it for you if you get real close!"
FRANK
Oh, yes, now I'm with you.
[he changes his accent]
But, gee, Mister, I've got my license to think of ... we're doing a hundred now ...
The car is stopped in traffic behind a bus. JOHN gets out of car and walks to the front. JOHN leans in window delightedly, he flashes his wallet.
JOHN
Ever seen one of these before?
FRANK
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
JOHN
I see you go to the night court.
FRANK
I've made the scene.
JOHN
Well, remember, its Leathery Magee up ahead in that convertible, so cover me in the stake-out.
GEORGE
I don't think that bit's right.
JOHN
What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?
34. EXTERIOR STREET
As the big car overtakes a Company Director's Rolls. JOHN lowers his window and the boys let out an imaginary hail of bullets at the Executive in the back. He reacts violently and starts to shout at them. As he does so, he presses the bu*ton of his window, so that we hear only part of it. But what we do is unpleasant. He immediately presses the bu*ton and the window rises.
RINGO and PAUL jump out of the car. RINGO takes two drumsticks from his coat pocket and, using them as banderillas, inserts them with style into the radiator grill (V.O. "Ole" from the BOYS). PAUL, then, using his coat as a matador's cloak, does a bu*terfly pa** at the car which
has just started up, narrowly missing him, but he keeps in the matador position.
35. INTERIOR CAR
NORM
Will you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.
JOHN
(as Ringo and Paul climb in)
Well, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.
FRANK
(to Norm)
We're nearly there, sir.
JOHN
Eh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.
CLOSE SHOT of a long suffering NORM.
NORM
And I was happy in the bakery. I'll never know
why I left.
36. EXTERIOR OF AN OLD VICTORIAN MUSIC HALL THEATRE
Which has been converted to the T.V. studios.
There are a few groups of GIRL FANS standing outside the front of the theatre, but against the kerb of the pavement is a night-watchman's canvas hut and brazier.
The car approaches.
37. INTERIOR OF THE CAR
NORM
Get ready John, open the door and as it draws up, out you go and straight in.
JOHN nods and opens the door. The FANS start to swarm 'round them. To escape, the BOYS dash into the night-watchman's canvas hut, pick it up and run with it to the stage door, revealing the night watchman, staring in astonishment.
At the door the BOYS put the hut down and enter the theatre.
38. INTERIOR STAGE DOOR ENTRANCE
As the BOYS enter, two P.R.O. men in dark suits, stiff white collars
and old school ties step forward and smile menacingly.
FIRST P.R.O. MAN
(menacingly)
Press conference, they're waiting for you.
NORM
(jovially)
Give us a couple of shakes to get our breath.
FIRST P.R.O. MAN
(more menacingly)
They're waiting now!
And without more ado they grab an arm each and march the protesting NORM towards the stairs that lead to the dress circle.
PAUL
Eh this lot means it. They're even taking
hostages.
The BOYS, SHAKE and GRANDFATHER rush after the rapidly disappearing NORM, who by now is half way up the stairs.
39. INTERIOR OF DRESS CIRCLE LOUNGE BALLROOM
It is empty except for two barmaids poised ready to serve, standing behind trestle tables full of drinks and sandwiches. The dark suited MEN enter with NORM and close behind them follow GRANDFATHER, SHAKE and the boys. The group arrives at the centre of the lounge and have time to look about and see the food but before they can get to it, from all directions NEWSPAPERMEN and PHOTOGRAPHERS converge upon them..
Now begins an elaborate tug-of-war between various PHOTOGRAPHERS using their flash attachments and REPORTERS to capture a Beatle and in the midst of this running battle a man with a portable recorder is trying to interview them. Together and singly the BOYS are pushed about the room and while this goes on a hard core of NEWSPAPERMEN are busily devouring sandwiches and pouring themselves drinks, to the annoyance of the BARMAIDS.
Every time one of the BOYS attempts to get a sandwich or a drink, it is either too late, the plate is empty, or they are intercepted. The single and constant thing we see in the scene is the pushing and pulling, heavy impersonal handling, the boys are just things to be placed like still life in one advantageous position after another. During the scene these individual exchanges take place:
SOUND REPORTER
What's your philosophy of life?
JOHN
I'm torn between Zen and I'm all right, Jack.
REPORTER
Has success changed your life?
RINGO
Yes.
REPORTER
Do you like playing the guitar?
GEORGE
Next to kissing girls it's favourites.
PAUL is surrounded by newspapermen.
PAUL
No, actually, we're just good friends.
HIGH SHOT of the press reception and we see the BOYS ease their way out until they get to the curtained entrance to the dress circle; completely unnoticed, they slip through.
40. INTERIOR THEATRE DRESS CIRCLE
The BOYS come up the stairs into the Dress Circle proper. GRANDFATHER and SHAKE are sitting there having a picnic of beer and sandwiches.
PAUL
(ironically)
Anything to spare?
GRANDFATHER
We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
GEORGE
Sure.
(He does so).
PAUL
Ah well. Eh, look!
He points, and from PAUL'S P.O.V. we see on stage, the setting up of the show, scenery and lights, cameras and sound equipment are being put into position by a small army of studio staff. DANCERS and SINGERS are milling about as well.
PAUL
Let's go and muck in.
JOHN
Aye, before anyone stops us.
They exit to rows of the dress circle and go through the entrance down the narrow stairs to the stalls and on to the stage that is built and extended right into the stalls, which are partly covered up.
41. INTERIOR STAGE
Everyone is so busy that they hardly notice the BOYS, who wander about and examine the studio equipment. A load of three drum sets are being brought on stage and a voice shouts out:
VOICE
Here, what about these electric guitars?
SHAKE
Where are they?
VOICE
Back here, mate.
SHAKE
(going towards the voice)
I'm coming.
RINGO is busy setting up his drums, and men are setting up the other sets. He drops a stick and the FLOOR MANAGER retrieves it and is about to tap the drum. The FLOOR MANAGER is a languid young man.
RINGO
Leave them drums alone.
FLOOR MANAGER
Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
RINGO
If you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm
out on strike.
FLOOR MANAGER
Aren't you being rather arbitrary?
RINGO
That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?
FLOOR MANAGER
Spoil sport!
RINGO
Well!
RINGO fusses like a mother hen clucking over his drums. The FLOOR MANAGER is furious.
GEORGE
He's very touchy about those his drums, they loom large in his legend.
RINGO gives his drums a defiant crash and JOHN and PAUL stop whatever they are up to and hurry over.
PAUL
What's up?
GEORGE
(pointing)
He's sulking again.
JOHN
I'll show him.
He picks up a set of drum sticks and bashes back at RINGO, who does a more complicated drum roll. GEORGE now joins in and to PAUL'S encouragement a drum duel starts completely naturally and improvised. During this encounter the work proceeds around them and the guitars are brought on and SHAKE sets them to working order. PAUL first, then JOHN and GEORGE take up their own instruments and out of the drum duel emerges one of their numbers.
42. INTERIOR RAMP
As the number finishes a baldheaded man (he is the T.V. director) storms down the ramp that leads from the control box under the dress circle.
DIRECTOR
(with over-exaggerated calm)
All right I'm sorry and let's hear no more about it. If that's your opinion, you're probably right. Look, if you think I'm unsuitable let's have it out in the open, I can't stand these back-stage politics.
By the end of this speech he is standing in front of JOHN who takes the scene in his stride.
JOHN
Aren't you tending to black and white this whole situation?
DIRECTOR
Well, quite honestly I wasn't expecting "a musical arranger" who would question my ability ... picture-wise.
JOHN
(to the others)
I could listen to him for hours.
PAUL
Heave to, what's all this about a musical arranger?
DIRECTOR
Mr. McCartney Senior!
The BOYS have a giggle at the very idea and at this moment GRANDFATHER appears from behind the DIRECTOR.
GRANDFATHER
Hey Pauly, they're trying to fob you off wid this musical charlatan but I've given him the test.
DIRECTOR
(bravely)
I'm quite happy to be replaced.
GRANDFATHER
(indicating the director)
He's a typical buck-pa**er.
DIRECTOR
I won an award.
JOHN
A likely story.
DIRECTOR
It's on the wall in my office.
At this moment NORM comes on the stage, confident, cigar in mouth and serene.
NORM
Hello our lot, everyone happy?
The BOYS, the DIRECTOR, FLOOR MANAGER and GRANDFATHER turn on him and stare silently.
NORM
All right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do.
DIRECTOR
Please do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you.
He glares at GRANDFATHER who glares right back. The DIRECTOR walks away with the FLOOR MANAGER pacifying him.
DIRECTOR
Give me a bottle of milk and a packet of
Oblivion. Oh, it's a plot, I see it now, it's
all a plot.
They go left towards the back-stage.
NORM
(producing key)
Now, come on, I've got the key.
He leads the lads off right. RINGO is last as he is putting his drum sticks down safely.
NORM and the BOYS turn on him.
NORM
Let's have you.
JOHN
Come on speedy!
PAUL
Ringo!
GEORGE
Wake up!
RINGO glares at them and follows quickly. As the BOYS move off after NORM, they pa** the next act waiting for rehearsal. It is an elegant man in full-tail suit meticulously adjusting his cuff-links. Beside him is a free-standing sign reading "Leslie Jackson and his ten disappearing doves." The BOYS pa** him and go through the door. GRANDFATHER stops and looks at the performer with respect.
GRANDFATHER
I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed your act.
He slaps the man on the back with happy camaraderie. There is the sound of a dove, a few feathers fall out of the sleeve of the man's coat and he and GRANDFATHER look down at the floor. The man glares at GRANDFATHER, takes out a pen from his pocket, crosses out "10" on his sign, and writes "9" in its place, puts the pen back in his pocket and starts towards the centre stage putting on a false performer's smile as he does.
43. INTERIOR THEATRE BACK-STAGE CORRIDOR
The BOYS move down the narrow stairs, and out of the ground floor dressing rooms stream a steady flow of costumed actors and actresses. They engulf the lads and force them against the wall -- the actors are all making for the stage door. As the actors push past the boys we see the boys' excited faces, their mouths watering for the costumes. JOHN touches the costume on one actor.
JOHN
(to actor)
Gear costume!
ACTOR
(eyeing him)
Swap?
NORM
Right, first floor and no messing about.
NORM, leading the way, goes up the stairs but as they turn the first corner they are confronted by a group of girls, a game of manners starts, "after you," "No, after you." NORM who is ahead of the group looks down on them in disgust.
NORM
Lennon, leave them girls alone or I'll report you.
The BOYS let the GIRLS pa** and resume the journey, always surrounded by people.
44. INTERIOR DRESSING ROOM AND CORRIDOR
RINGO'S attention is caught by a door. He crosses and opens it, looking out to a fire escape. The others join him and the four boys step through the door and onto the fire escape.
45. EXTERIOR TOP OF FIRE ESCAPE
From the BOYS' P.O.V. we see down below into the property yard behind nthe theatre. It is a long narrow yard full of old coaches, motor cars and all the general debris of hundreds of sets from past theatre shows. Through the piles of heaped high junk there are a couple of narrow alleyways.
The BOYS scamper down the fire escape.
When they reach the bottom of the alleyways, there is a large door. They open it and look through.
From their P.O.V. we see a large green field quite empty. The boys step through the doorway into the field. We now see from a HELICOPTER SHOT the four BOYS standing together surrounded by space.
It is the first time they have been alone and unconfined all day.
They look at each other and grin ... then first GEORGE and PAUL let out a whoop and run towards the centre of the field, after a moment JOHN and RINGO follow them. The BOYS pick up some loose straw and insert it under JOHN'S cap and sleeves, turning him into a scarecrow.
The four BOYS dash about madly calling out to one another and generally horsing around. Out of this emerges an imaginary game of soccer and although there is no ball the game is fast and furious. After a few moments the long shadow of a man falls across the gra**.
MAN'S VOICE
(off)
I suppose you know this is private property.
The boys freeze.
From their P.O.V. we see a big burly middle-aged man glowering at them. The boys exchange rueful glances and, under the big man's eye, mooch back towards the gateway they came in by. JOHN is the last to go through. He turns to the man.
JOHN
Sorry if we hurt your field, Mister.
46. INTERIOR CORRIDOR BACK-STAGE
GRANDFATHER is sneaking down the corridor, a pile of photos under his arm.
47. INTERIOR T.V. THEATRE UNDERNEATH THE STAGE
Under the stage the usual set of wooden columns that support the stage with lots of furniture and a single light is on; it is placed by the orchestra's entrance to the orchestra pit. GRANDFATHER comes down the stairs and winds his way through the columns until he finds himself a safe little cubby hole and settles himself under the light. He spreads the signed photos of the BOYS in front of him and, adjusting an old- fashioned pair of gla**es, ball-point pen in hand begins to copy the BOYS' signatures on to the fresh photos, tutting at his failures and chuckling at his successes. After a moment, there is a sound of someone coming down the stairs. GRANDFATHER darts into a dark patch out of sight.
The menacing shadows appear on the stairway.
NORM (voice off)
There's no one here.
SHAKE (voice off)
This is the only way they could have gone.
We now see GRANDFATHER holding himself stiffly in, he is on some sort of raised platform and he fidgets and in doing so he knocks a lever of some sort. Slowly GRANDFATHER ascends out of shot with a light that grows bigger above him.
48. INTERIOR T.V. THEATRE STAGE
A rehearsal of the toast scene from a Strauss Operetta. The entire stage is full of SINGERS, gla**es in hand they are singing away at each other but in true opera tradition they are addressing out to the audience. Slowly in-between the leading man and leading woman, who are about to embrace, a stage trap opens and a blinking, surprised, GRANDFATHER appears. Here we INTERCUT to the T.V. Control Room for amazed reaction shots of the DIRECTOR and control room CREW.
Back now on the stage the toast song reaches its climax and the leading man and woman rush into each other's arms, GRANDFATHER sandwiched between them.
48A. INTERIOR CORRIDOR AS BOYS PASS THRU ON WAY TO DRESSING ROOM
JOHN is behind them. JOHN, BOYS and MILLIE are walking towards each other.
MILLIE
(as all pa**)
Hello.
JOHN
(stopping... the boys carry on past, not noticing her)
Hello.
MILLIE
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
JOHN
No, not me.
MILLIE
(insistently)
Oh you are, I know you are.
JOHN
No, I'm not.
MILLIE
You are.
JOHN
I'm not, no.
MILLIE
Well, you look like him.
JOHN
Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
MILLIE
Oh you do, look.
JOHN looks at himself in the mirror.
JOHN examines himself in the mirror carefully.
JOHN
My eyes are lighter.
MILLIE
(agreeing)
Oh yes.
JOHN
And my nose...
MILLIE
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
JOHN
Is it?
MILLIE
I would have said so.
JOHN
Aye, but you know him well.
MILLIE
(indignantly)
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
JOHN
(knowingly)
That's what you tell me.
MILLIE
(suspiciously)
What have you heard?
JOHN
(blandly)
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
MILLIE
Is it? Is it really?
JOHN
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
MILLIE
I knew I could rely on you.
JOHN
(modestly)
Thanks.
MILLIE touches his arm then walks away. After a moment she turns.
MILLIE
You don't look like him at all.
JOHN winks at her and she winks back.
49. INTERIOR DRESSING ROOM
NORM and SHAKE enter the room. The BOYS' TAILOR is there waiting for the BOYS.
SHAKE
Oh they've probably gone to the canteen, cup of tea, like.
NORM
That's too easy for Lennon.
He crosses to door leading to fire escape.
NORM
(dramatically)
He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
SHAKE
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
NORM
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
SHAKE
But John hasn't got any.
NORM
What?
SHAKE
Nerves.
NORM
I know, that's the trouble.
He puffs nervously at his cigarette.




NORM
Oh, I've toyed with the idea of a ball and chain but he'd only rattle them at me... and in public and all. Sometimes I think he enjoys seeing me suffer.
He hears something.
NORM
Get behind that door, they're coming. Someone's coming. Quick, hide!
The two men hide behind the door. The boys enter the room, as JOHN is last he shuts the door and faces SHAKE and NORM.
JOHN
What are you doing there?
SHAKE
Hiding.
JOHN
I think you're soft or something.
NORM
We weren't hiding.
TAILOR
Now?
NORM
Now. We were trying to catch you redhanded. I thought I told you lot to stay here?
RINGO
Well ...
NORM
When I tell you to stay put, stay put.
JOHN
(down on his knees)
Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray.
NORM
Oh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting
for you in the studio.
RINGO
Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.
NORM
Good lad, Ringo.
PAUL
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
GEORGE
You crawler.
JOHN
He's betrayed the cla**.
RINGO
Oh, leave off!!!
JOHN
Temper! Temper!
RINGO
Well ...
CLOSE-UP on NORM's long suffering face.
NORM
Will you all get a move on! They're waiting for
you!
By this time the TAILOR has his tape stretched between his hands to measure GEORGE's shoulders. But since GEORGE has moved away, he is measuring space. JOHN takes up his scissors and cuts the tape.
JOHN
I now declare this bridge open.
The BOYS run out the door.
50. INTERIOR BACKSTAGE AREA
Five beautiful MODELS are standing about in costume. One is knitting a loose wool sweater which is almost completed. There is the sound of a juggling act's music off and a few of the girls are looking off towards the centre stage. At the edge of frame is a collapsible table covered with green baize. On it are three spaced white plates.
From the door off stage, above which is a sign "To Canteen and Production Offices", GRANDFATHER enters eating a plate of spaghetti on toast. The knitting GIRL sees him and, in mime, asks him to stand still so that she can measure the sweater against him. GRANDFATHER, eager to help, puts his plate of food on the green table between plates two and
three. He goes to be measured with the sweater.
From the onstage area, a juggler's ASSISTANT (pretty girl) in costume backs up and with the usual theatrical flourishes picks up, without looking, plate number ONE and throws it off screen towards centre stage. There is a drum roll from orchestra. She then throws plate number TWO. We CUT on stage to the JUGGLER now balancing the two spinning plates on two poles, one in each hand. He has another pole in his mouth and nods to his ASSISTANT, asking for the THIRD plate.
We CUT BACK to the ASSISTANT who, still not looking, throws plate THREE which is GRANDFATHER's. There is the sound of an orchestra raggedly stopping and all the hangers-on in the scene look off interestedly.
We hear the DIRECTOR's voice.
DIRECTOR (V.O.)
All right, hold it, hold it... O.K. John, wipe him down and we'll carry on with the next act.
We
CUT TO
centre stage. The JUGGLER is as before but the spaghetti is covering his head, having slipped off the third plate.
The FLOOR MANAGER is bustling around, trying to help.
We CUT BACK to back-stage. GRANDFATHER has finished being measured and goes to the green table where he put his plate down. He picks up the only remaining plate, looks at it, wondering where his food has gone, shrugs and heads back towards the exit door as we hear the DIRECTOR's VOICE.
51. INTERIOR T.V. STUDIO FLOOR
CLOSE-UP on the distraught DIRECTOR.
DIRECTOR
Where are they? I said, where are they? Where are they?
FLOOR MANAGER
(placating)
They're coming, I promise you.
DIRECTOR
(fiercely)
Now look, if they're not here on this floor in thirty seconds there's going to be trouble ... understand me ... trouble!!!
Two STAGE HANDS are walking disinterestedly past, they look at the DIRECTOR.
1st STAGE HAND
What's he on about, Taff?
WELSH STAGE HAND
Well ... he's being the director. Of course, he lives in a world of his own, mind.
At this moment the boys, NORM, SHAKE and GRANDFATHER appear. The BOYS grab their instruments and prepare to play.
JOHN
(to the director)
Standing about, eh? Some people have it dead easy, don't they?
The director is about to blow his top but manages to hold on and mutter to the heavens.
DIRECTOR
(to himself)
Of course, once you're over thirty, you're finished. It's a young man's medium and I just can't take the pace.
RINGO
Are you as young as that, then?
BOYS
Shurrup!
GRANDFATHER
Isn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.
PAUL
(to Shake)
Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?
SHAKE
I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
PAUL
(threateningly)
I'll set John on you!
SHAKE
(hastily)
Oh, anything you say, Paul.
He leads GRANDFATHER away.
The BOYS are placed in position, instruments ready. The boom moves in near them. There is a mike hovering just over JOHN'S head. JOHN starts attacking it.
DIRECTOR'S VOICE (over Tannoy)
Run through the number and try not to jiggle out of your positions.
The BOYS start the number, as the stage hands adjust their settings. When they've finished, they stand about spare.
52. INTERIOR T.V. CONTROL ROOM
The room is crowded with the usual personnel, P.A., elecs, racks, etc.... make-up supervisor and wardrobe mistress.
DIRECTOR
That was more or less all right for me. I'll give them one more run through then leave them alone until the dress ...
(to make-up woman)
Oh how about make-up?
MAKE-UP WOMAN
Not really, they don't need it any. We'll just powder them off for shine.
DIRECTOR
Good. Norm, get them along to make-up will you?
NORM
(rising)
Sure.
DIRECTOR
(looking into the monitor)
And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
From the director's P.O.V. we see into the monitor. The boys crowding around RINGO. We cut through the monitor into the same position in the studio.
53. INTERIOR T.V. STUDIO FLOOR
PAUL
(to Ringo)
What's the matter with you? You were bashing away like a madman.
RINGO
(briefly)
You were twanging too loud.
JOHN
How'd you like a dirty great drum roll giving you a clout right in the middle of your solo?
GEORGE
You're getting out of hand. I don't know what's come over you today.
RINGO
That's right. It's always me, isn't it?
JOHN
Since you ask, yes.
(he laughs)
Aah, come on, Ring, we love you.
He puts his arm around Ringo's shoulder.
RINGO
Well!
JOHN
He'll get over it.
NORM appears down the ramp speaking as he approaches.
NORM
All right, our lot, make-up.
54. INTERIOR MAKE UP ROOM
A smallish room with a line of chairs facing a wall mirror and a long table. Each place is clearly marked and above each mirror a girl's name: Betty, Angela, Deirdre, Jenny.
SHAKE and GRANDFATHER are sitting in splendid isolation. They are staring each other out.
SHAKE
You blinked!
GRANDFATHER
I never did, you did.
The BOYS enter.
SHAKE
Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.
GEORGE
Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the
champ here.
He indicates RINGO who ignores him.
NORM
Stop picking on him.
RINGO
I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.
JOHN
Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.
NORM
Sit down, the lot of you.
At this moment several actors come into the room. They are all dressed in the uniform of officers in Wellington's army. Together with the boys they sit down, Beatles and soldiers all mixed up.
Now a group of several pretty make-up girls make an entrance and the boys herald their arrival with a chorus of "aye aye's" and wolf whistles. JOHN meanwhile has helped himself to a big beard and the other lads are generally messing about with a**orted make-up things.
HEAD MAKE UP GIRL
Oh, this is impossible! We'll never get you all done in time.
ACTOR
Well, you'll just have to do us first... It makes no difference to them whether they're made up or not.
(sees John with beard)
And who's me, then?
JOHN
(charmingly)
My name's Betty...
(pointing to the name on the mirror)
Do you want a punch up your frogged tunic?
NORM fights his way to JOHN.
NORM
Now listen, John, behave yourself or I'll murder you and, Shake, take that wig off, it suits you.
SHAKE has a long blond girl's wig on. With the a**istance of the girls, NORM gets the boys seated into the chairs nearest the door. For some reason RINGO now has a Guardsman's busby wedged down almost over his eyes and is sitting with it under a hair drier, reading a copy of "Queen" Magazine.
NORM
(to Ringo)
What do you think are you're up to?
RINGO
Someone put it on me.
JOHN
Excuses, that's all we get and you know you fancy yourself in the Coldstreams.
The GIRLS now move in and put make up bibs on the BOYS and start to powder them off.
JOHN
You won't interfere with the basic rugged
concept of my personality, will you, girl?
PAUL
Eh, don't take out me lines.
GEORGE
Yeah, they give him that "Je ne sais quoi"
rakish air.
The lads laugh with pleasure.
RINGO decides to try a little joke.
RINGO
(indicating the busby he is still
wearing)
Short back and sides, please.
The other look at him with mock disgust.
PAUL
Behave...
JOHN
Foreign devil ...
GEORGE
Control yourself...
GRANDFATHER has been watching the powdering process.
GRANDFATHER
In my considered opinion you're a bunch of sissies.
JOHN grabs a powder puff from his girl.
JOHN
You know you're only jealous!
And dabs the old man liberally with the powder much to GRANDFATHER's annoyance.
NORM
Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you.
JOHN
You wouldn't!
NORM
I would though.
NORM goes out.
PAUL
What's he know?
JOHN
Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.
GRANDFATHER
(impatiently)
Lookit, I thought I was supposed to be getting a change of scenery and so far I've seen a train and a room, a car and a room and a room and a room. Well, that's maybe all right for a bunch of powdered gee-gaws like you lot but I'm feeling decidedly strait-jacketed. This is no life for a free-booting agent of my stamp. I'm a frustrated man and that cla** of McCartney is a dangerous McCartney.
GIRL
(admiringly)
What a clean old man.
GRANDFATHER
(touchingly)
You're too young for a fella of my cosmopolitan tastes, so don't press your luck.
JOHN
He's s**-obsessed, the older generation are leading this country to galloping ruin.
NORM returns leaving the door open, the boys hear the sound of music coming from the studio.
NORM
They're nearly ready for you. They're just finishing the band call.
JOHN
(jumping from his seat)
Gear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance.
JOHN'S GIRL
I don't think its allowed.
JOHN
Well ... it wouldn't be any fun if it was!
The BOYS drag the make-up GIRLS out of the room and into the studio.
The GIRLS are still trying to finish making the BOYS up.
As the BOYS and MAKE-UP GIRLS dance past, we see one of the "Strauss" singers combing his long hair straight back. Two STAGE HANDS swing a wind machine past him and his hair is blown straight forward into a Beatle cut.
JOHN
(pa**ing him)
Never.
During dance, GEORGE takes off wig and places it on dummy, revealing identical hair underneath.
55. INTERIOR T.V. STUDIO FLOOR
The work is still going on and the music is up full blast, the BOYS enter and with the GIRLS [and] they start a wild dance, hippy, shake, zulu, blue beat, the lot. LIONEL and DANCERS are doing their routine on one side of the stage ... it becomes a challenge dance between both groups. JOHN swings his GIRL onto the motorized CAMERA, Western style, and starts to track through the GROUP. GEORGE is on another CAMERA.
56. INTERIOR CONTROL ROOM
The whole control room crew are watching the dance on all the monitors. The DIRECTOR is about to stop the boys but his GIRL P.A. glares at him, with a shrug he lets the dance go on.
We now cut between the dancers on the monitors and the boys actual dancing down on the studio floor. When the recorded music stops, they grab their instruments and go into a number.
So we can watch every aspect of their work and with so many monitors it gives the impression that there are many more boys than just four.
When the number finally ends we are back in the studio on the floor.
57. INTERIOR T.V. STUDIO FLOOR
DIRECTOR'S VOICE OVER TANNOY
Thank you gentlemen, you can break now while we push on with the show.
The boys acknowledge this with a quaver of guitar chords and a drum roll.
NORM is on them at once.
NORM
That was great, you've got about an hour but don't leave the theatre.
JOHN grabs the arm of a s**y girl dancer.
JOHN
She's going to show me her stamp collection.
PAUL
(grabs a showgirl)
So's mine.
NORM
John, I'm talking to you. This final run through is important. Understand? Important.
JOHN
(like a pig)
Oink! Oink!
They dash off with the two beauties.
GRANDFATHER is hovering in the background with SHAKE.
GRANDFATHER
I want me cup of tea.
NORM
Shake.
SHAKE
I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
NORM
Clever.
(he turns)
George.
But GEORGE is disappearing out of the door.
NORM turns to RINGO.
NORM
Look after him.
RINGO
But...
NORM
Do I have to raise me voice?
RINGO
(choked)
Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
And the two of them walk off, Ringo leading.
57A. INTERIOR BACKSTAGE
A man, whose act is playing tunes by hitting himself on the head, is swallowing a handful of aspirin tablets. He starts rehearsing his act, which consists of throwing his head back and slapping his cheeks. Next to him, a JUGGLER is practising with four table tennis balls.
GRANDFATHER pa**es him and bumps his arm slightly. Only 3 balls come down. There is the sound of coughing off.
We
CUT TO
THE HEAD-PLAYER being patted on the back. The ball drops out of his mouth and bounces slowly on the studio floor.
58. INTERIOR T.V. STUDIO CANTEEN
The canteen is about half full of actors many of which are dressed as Nazi soldiers, with mock blood bandages and arm bands. Also there are a sprinkling of T.V. people. At a table sits GRANDFATHER and RINGO. RINGO is deeply engrossed in a book and GRANDFATHER has a near empty cup of tea in front of him. The old man is bored and looks about him slyly. He then looks at Ringo who is innocently occupied, a malicious gleam comes into GRANDFATHER's eye. He decides to have a go at RINGO and sits staring at him. RINGO gradually becomes aware of the stare and shifts uncomfortably then tries to continue reading his book.
GRANDFATHER
(disgustedly to no one in particular)
Will you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!
RINGO
Well ... what's the matter with that?
GRANDFATHER
(taking the book from him)
Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
RINGO
(snatching back his book)
You can learn from books.
GRANDFATHER
Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
RINGO
Out where?
GRANDFATHER
Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
RINGO
(defiantly)
Books are good!
GRANDFATHER
(countering)
Parading's better!
RINGO
Parading?
GRANDFATHER
(marching up and down the canteen)
That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
RINGO
Well, I am living, aren't I?
GRANDFATHER
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarra** a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
RINGO
Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
GRANDFATHER
At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
RINGO
Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
GRANDFATHER
So you are a man after all.
RINGO
What's that mean?
GRANDFATHER
Do you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.
RINGO
(not too sure)
Oh ... I dunno.
GRANDFATHER
(confidingly)
And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.
RINGO
Yeah ... that's right.
GRANDFATHER
And what's it all come to in the end?
RINGO
(defensively)
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
GRANDFATHER
A book!
RINGO
Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
He throws the book down.
GRANDFATHER
When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the cla** of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.
RINGO
Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
GRANDFATHER
(nodding)
You're only right.
RINGO
(nodding back)
I'm not wrong.
There is a pause, then RINGO rises and crosses to the door.
GRANDFATHER
Where are you off to?
RINGO
I'm going parading before it's too late!
RINGO leaves and GRANDFATHER laughs at what he has done, then realizes its full meaning and looks worried.
59. INTERIOR CORRIDOR and STAIRWAY
RINGO comes along the corridor then down the narrow stairs. Half-way down he comes face to face with GEORGE who is coming up the stairs.
GEORGE
Eh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?
RINGO
(pa**ing him)
No. I don't.
As he goes round the corner RINGO turns on the surprised GEORGE.
RINGO
You want to stop being so scornful, it's twisting your face.
60. INTERIOR T.V. THEATRE NEAR STAGE DOORMAN'S OFFICE
JOHN and PAUL are chatting up a couple of girls, when they see RINGO approaching they break off the conversation.
JOHN
Here he is, the middle-aged boy wonder.
RINGO looks at JOHN hard.
PAUL
Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man.
RINGO
(with simple dignity)
Get knotted!
PAUL and JOHN gape at him. For good measure Ringo takes a quick photograph of them before he leaves them flabbergasted and walks off into the street.
PAUL
We've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us.
JOHN
Can't he? He's done it, son!
GEORGE runs towards them.
GEORGE
Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
PAUL
We do.
GEORGE
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
PAUL
He hasn't.
GEORGE
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
PAUL
The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.
The three of them go into the street.
61. EXTERIOR T.V. THEATRE STAGE DOOR ENTRANCE
The boys look up and down but RINGO has completely disappeared.
PAUL
We'll split up and search for him, he can't be far.
They now all start to go off in the same direction, they pause, there are three roads they can take but each time they begin to move they all go the same way.
JOHN
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
GEORGE
I'll look in here again.
PAUL gives him a push to the left and GEORGE to the right and going straight ahead himself they part and go their separate ways.
62. EXTERIOR STREET
RINGO is walking along taking photographs with his camera when some girls recognise him and start to follow him. They quicken their pace and RINGO runs ahead of them. He turns and comes into another street. He sees a second-hand clothes shop with a sign saying "We Buy Anything" and enters the shop just before the pursuing girls come round the corner. The girls stand about looking in all directions. After a moment RINGO comes out of the shop. He is wearing a long mackintosh and a natty cap pulled well down. He is ignored by the girls who don't recognise him. Realising this he goes back and ogles one of them. She glares at him.
RINGO
Hello.
GIRL
Get out of it, short house!
CLOSE-UP on Ringo's secret but happy smile as he walks briskly down the road.
63. EXTERIOR TOW PATH Can*l
RINGO kicks at a brick. He kicks stylishly but misses so tries again, misses again, but finally kicks the stone which doesn't budge so he bends down and pulls it out of the ground. It is quite big. Three quarters of it being below the surface. Having got it he now decides to throw it away. As he does so the same POLICEMAN rides past on a bicycle.
POLICEMAN
Ain't you got no more bleeding sense than to go round chucking bricks about.
Before RINGO has time to answer the man has disappeared.
RINGO
(shouting after him)
Southerner!
He looks at the can*l water moodily; at this moment a large lorry tyre rolls down the incline and bashes him slap in the back, sprawling him on the path, the tyre on top of him. A small boy appears after the tyre and stands over the prostrate RINGO.
BOY
Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.
RINGO
Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?
BOY
Oh don't be so stroppy!
RINGO
(getting up)
Well! A boy of your age bowling "hoop" at people. How old are you anyway?
BOY
(aggressively)
Nine.
RINGO
Bet you're only eight and a half.
BOY
(countering swiftly)
Eight and two thirds.
RINGO
Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
BOY
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
RINGO
Shurrup!
BOY
I bet you're
(searching for an age)
-- sixteen!
RINGO
Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
BOY
Well --
RINGO
All right, take your hoop and bowl.
He moves off and the BOY follows.
BOY
Oh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me.
RINGO
Y'what?
BOY
You heard, it gets on my wick.
RINGO
Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
BOY
I'm a deserter.
RINGO
(smiling in spite of himself)
Are you now?
BOY
Yeah, I've blown school out.
RINGO
Just you?
BOY
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
RINGO
Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
BOY
Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come
with us but they chickened.
RINGO
Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
BOY
(sighing)
Yeah.
RINGO
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
BOY
(defensively)
Oh, it's all right.
RINGO
(disbelievingly)
Yeah?
BOY
Yeah.
RINGO
What they like?
BOY is glad to have something to talk about.
BOY
(enthusiastically)
Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.
RINGO
How about Ding Dong?
BOY
He's a big head and he fancies himself with it but you know it's all right 'cos he's one of the gang.
RINGO nods his head understandingly and they mooch on together.
BOY
Why aren't you at work?
RINGO
I'm a deserter, too.
BOY
Oh.
At this moment a child's voice shouts out "Charley" and from RINGO'S P.O.V. we see three kids. RINGO turns to the BOY and looks at them enquiringly.
BOY
(to Ringo)
See you.
The BOY runs off to join his mates. As he joins them they punch and scuffle together. They are obviously a gang. RINGO is left alone.
64. INTERIOR CORRIDOR T.V. THEATRE
GEORGE comes round the corner, looking for RINGO, then grins and walks past a sign saying "Canteen and Production Office Opposite." He comes to the exit door, crosses to a modern building across from the theatre. He enters [the] building.
65. INTERIOR OFFICE
It is the reception room that leads to an inner office. Behind a desk sits a smart young woman typing busily as GEORGE enters. He is surprised when he sees the girl; she looks up and speaks to him at once.
SECRETARY
Oh, there you are!
GEORGE
Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.
SECRETARY
(tartly)
You haven't, you're just late.
(She rises and crossing over to him examines him critically.)
Oh, yes, he's going to be very pleased with you.
GEORGE
Is he?
SECRETARY
Yes, you're quite a feather in the cap.
(She crosses to the desk and picks up the inter-office phone.)
Hello, I've got one ... oh, I think so ... yes, he can talk ... Well ... I think you ought to see him.
(she smiles)
Of course, right away.
She crosses to the inter-office door. On the door is written SIMON MARSHAL ... she opens it.
SECRETARY
Well ... come on.
GEORGE
Sorry.
He follows her quickly in.
66. INTERIOR THE INNER OFFICE
A large room, part production office with models and sets, drawing board with ground plans, the other part of the room a mixture of Pop and Queen's magazine decor.
Behind a large desk sits SIMON MARSHAL, a bland but slightly irritable young man of about thirty-five. He is wearing the ultimate in the current smart set fashion. He is attended by a couple of underlings ADRIAN and TONY and behind him on the wall is a poster of a girl. Across the poster is printed, "Way Out, your own T.V. Special with Susan Campey. Director, Simon Marshal."
SECRETARY
(proudly)
Will this do, Simon?
SIMON
(looking at George)
Not bad, dolly, not really bad.
(he motions to George)
Turn around, chicky baby.
GEORGE does so.
SIMON
Oh yes, a definite poss. He'll look good alongside Susan.
(he indicates the girl on the poster)
All right, Sunny Jim, this is all going to be quite painless. Don't breathe on me, Adrian.
ADRIAN has recognised GEORGE and is trying to stop SIMON.
GEORGE
Look, I'm terribly sorry but I'm afraid there's been some sort of a misunderstanding.
SIMON
(sharply)
Oh, you can come off it with us. You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.
GEORGE
I'm afraid I don't understand.
SIMON
Oh, my God, he's a natural.
SECRETARY (anxiously)
Well, I did tell them not to send us any more real ones.
SIMON
They ought to know by now the phonies are much easier to handle. Still he's a good type.
He now speaks to GEORGE in the loud voice that the English reserve for foreigners and village idiots.
SIMON
We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.
GEORGE
Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
SIMON
Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.
(to secretary)
Can he read?
GEORGE
Of course I can.
SIMON
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
GEORGE
I'll have a bash.
SIMON
Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?
GEORGE
Ta.
SIMON
Well, at least he's polite. Tony Show him the shirts, Adrian.
A collection of shirts are produced and GEORGE looks at them. While he is doing this SIMON briefs him.
SIMON
Now, you'll like these. You really "dig" them. They're "fab" and all the other pimply hyperboles.
GEORGE
I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty.
SIMON
Grotty?
GEORGE
Yeah, grotesque.
SIMON
(to secretary)
Make a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think it's rather touching really. Here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want.
GEORGE
But I won't.
SIMON
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
GEORGE
I don't care.
SIMON
And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care pa**ionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.
GEORGE
And who's this Susan when she's at home?
SIMON
(playing his ace)
Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
GEORGE
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
SIMON
I beg your pardon?
GEORGE
Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
SIMON
She's a trend setter. It's her profession!
GEORGE
She's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.
SIMON
Get him out of here!!
GEORGE
(genuinely surprised)
Have I said something amiss?
SIMON
Get him out of here. He's knocking the programme's image!!
The underlings hustle GEORGE to the door.
GEORGE
(smiling)
Sorry about the shirts.
He is ejected through the door.
SIMON
Get him out.
(he stops in mid-shout)
You don't think he's a new phenomenon, do you?
SECRETARY
You mean an early clue to the new direction?
SIMON
(rummaging in his desk)
Where's the calendar?
(he finds it)
No, he's just a trouble maker. The change isn't due for three weeks. All the same, make a note not to extend Susan's contract. Let's not take any unnecessary chances!
67. EXTERIOR STREET PUB ON THE CORNER
The sign on the pub is Liverpool Arms. RINGO is standing looking up at it. He decides to go in and does so.
68. INTERIOR T.V. CONTROL ROOM
The atmosphere is tense. GRANDFATHER is standing miserable in front of the DIRECTOR, the criminal confronted by the judge. SHAKE and NORM are flanking him grimly.
GRANDFATHER
I'm sorry lads, I didn't mean it, honest.
DIRECTOR
If he says that again, I'll strike him.
SHAKE
(unconvincingly)
They'll be back, they're good lads, they'll be back.
DIRECTOR
(disgusted)
Yes? Well they've got only ten minutes to the final run-through.
GRANDFATHER
I meant no harm. I was only trying to encourage little Ringo to enjoy himself.
NORM
(grimly, C.U.)
God knows what you've unleashed on the unsuspecting South. It'll be wine, women and song all the way with Ringo once he's got the taste for it.
69. INT. PUB PUBLIC BAR
CLOSE-UP on RINGO. He is eating a bone dry sandwich that curls up at the end. He puts it down with disgust. He has a lager gla** in his hand.
BARMAID
(accusingly)
That was fresh this morning.
We now see the pub is full of enormous co*kney workmen downing pints. RINGO is very much alone. He moves away from the bar towards a group that is standing together, they've an average height of over six-foot. There is a group at a dart board. Another group is playing bar skittles and a third group is around a pin-ball table.
Near the bar is a shove-halfpenny board with two players. There is a caged parrot nearby.
BARMAID
(to Ringo)
That'll be two and nine...
RINGO fumbles some change out of his pocket. A few coppers fall from his hand on to the shove-halfpenny board just as the crucial point has been made. The men glare at him. Embarra**ed, he moves away and without looking, places his gla** on the skittles table just as a player swings the string, which hits Ringo's gla**. More embarra**ed, RINGO backs
away, unfortunately into the pin-table just as a winning score is about to be reached. He bumps it very slightly, but enough to cause it to TILT. He then moves to the dart board. By this time most of the pub is staring at him. With great style he takes the darts. The first throw goes into a cheese sandwich which a man is pointing in demonstration. The second we see arrive into a pint of bitter and then we see RINGO shoot the third dart and hear the sound of the parrot shouting angrily, off. The BARMAID has had enough.
BARMAID
Right ... On your way!
RINGO
Y'what?
BARMAID
You heard, on your way, troublemaker!
Now the centre of attention, RINGO backs out of the pub, followed by every eye in the place, the BARMAID and a few players following him to the door ...
70. EXTERIOR STREET OUTSIDE PUB
RINGO comes out and crosses road, watched by the POLICEMAN who is now quite suspicious.
71. EXTERIOR STREET
PAUL comes down the street looking about him for RINGO. In the street is an old building, the sort of place that is highly favoured for TV rehearsals. There is a sign on the door, "TV Rehearsal Room." As PAUL draws near, a load of actors and extras, etc. are leaving, they are in costume, they are the ones who earlier had been going to a word rehearsal. When PAUL gets near the entrance he decides to go inside.
72. INTERIOR HALL
PAUL enters and wanders about. He reaches a door, pushes it open and looks in. He sees a GIRL clad in period costume. She is moving around the room and obviously acting. PAUL watches her for a moment and then decides to go in.
73. INTERIOR REHEARSAL ROOM
PAUL goes into the room. The GIRL is in mid-flight. She is very young and lovely and completely engrossed in what she is doing. The room is absolutely empty except for PAUL and herself. She is acting in the manner of an eighteenth-century coquette, or, to be precise, the voice English actresses use when they think they are being true to the costume period ... her youth however makes it all very charming.
GIRL
If I believed you, sir, I might do those things and walk those ways only to find myself on Problem's Path. But I cannot believe you, and all those urgings serve only as a proof that you will lie and lie again to gain your purpose with me.
She dances lightly away from an imaginary lover and as she turns she sees PAUL who is as engrossed in the scene as she was.
GIRL
(surprised)
Oh!
PAUL
(enthusiastically)
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
GIRL
Go away! You've spoilt it.
PAUL
Oh, sorry I spoke.
He makes no attempt to go. He simply continues to look steadily at the girl; then he smiles at her. She is undecided what to do next.
GIRL
Are you supposed to be here?
PAUL
I've got you worried, haven't I?
GIRL
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
PAUL
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
GIRL
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
PAUL
(ironically)
How'd you guess?
GIRL
(seriously)
Oh, it's the way you talk.
PAUL
(innocently)
Is it ... is it, really?
GIRL
(suspiciously)
Are you pulling my leg?
PAUL
(looking her straight in the eye)
Something like that.
GIRL
(unsure)
I see.
(airily)
Do you like the play?
PAUL
Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.
(smiles to himself)
Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
GIRL
Gear?
PAUL
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
GIRL
Thank you.
PAUL
Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?
GIRL pouts.
PAUL
You don't half slam the door in people's faces, do you? I mean, what about when you're playing the part, like, hundreds of people'll see you and ...
GIRL
(cutting in)
I'm not ...
PAUL
Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
GIRL
No.
(aggressively)
I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.
PAUL
Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?
GIRL
Yes.
PAUL
Aye, I knew you were.
GIRL
What's that mean?
PAUL
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....
(he imitates her)
"I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
GIRL
(dryly)
The big hammer?
PAUL
(smiling)
Oh aye, a sledge.
GIRL
But the way you did it then sounded so phony.
PAUL
No ... I wouldn't say that ... just like an actress ... you know.
He moves and stands about like an actress.
GIRL
But that's not like a real person at all.
PAUL
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
GIRL
They ought to be.
PAUL
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
GIRL
(teasingly)
What are you?
PAUL
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
GIRL
I bet you don't sound like real people.
PAUL
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
GIRL
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
PAUL
What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.
He laughs and with a gesture takes in the whole studio
PAUL
... all this and a jam bu*ty too!!
GIRL
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
PAUL
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
GIRL
Why selfish?
PAUL
Well, you've got to have people to taste your treacle toffee.
She looks at him in surprise.
PAUL
No, hang on, I've not gone daft. You see, when I was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery. When I'd done she said to me, "Go and give some to the other kids." So, I said I would but I thought to meself, "She must think I'm soft." Anyroad, I was eating away there but I wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end I wound up giving it all away ... but I didn't nmind, mind, 'cos I'd made the stuff in the first place. Well ... that's why you need other people... an audience ... to taste your treacle toffee, like. Eh ... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me?
GIRL
Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
PAUL
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
GIRL
Is she?
PAUL
Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...
(Paul starts acting a Liverpool girl, he minces about then turns, extending his leg)
Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
GIRL
(shattered)
And you honestly think that's what she meant?
PAUL
Oh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, she's trying to get him to marry her but he doesn't want ... well ... I don't reckon any fella's ever wanted to get married. But girls are like that, clever and cunning. You've got to laugh.
He laughs.
GIRL
Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever.
PAUL
(grinning)
And cunning.
GIRL
And what do you do about it?
PAUL
Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
GIRL
Pity.
PAUL
(not noticing the invitation)
Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.
GIRL
Yes.
PAUL
(going)
See you.
GIRL
Of course.
PAUL stands at the doorway, shrugs then goes out.
74. EXTERIOR STREET
In the street, workmen are collecting shovels, drinking tea and doing all the things people do around building sites. RINGO mooches around. In the road is a hole with a diameter of about 3 feet, and at least 6 feet deep. RINGO looks down and a man is busily working at the bottom of the hole. He glares at RINGO. After a moment RINGO turns away. We now see a very elegant young lady coming towards RINGO. She is daintily avoiding a series of puddles. RINGO has an idea and does a Sir Walter Raleigh with his large Mac spreading it over one of the puddles. The girl walks across it smiling graciously. RINGO proceeds with the coat to the next puddle and to the next backing gradually towards the hole. At last he spreads the coat, without noticing what he is doing, over the hole. The girl steps onto the coat and disappears sharply. RINGO looks down the hole where the girl is held in the workman's arms. The workman rises out of the manhole until he is waist height. At this point an elegantly dressed gentleman appears (the girl's husband) he looks at his wife in the workman's arms and hits the workman. RINGO backs away through the puddles, and is nicked by the POLICEMAN.
[Scenes 75 and 76 deleted in revision.]
77. INTERIOR T.V. THEATRE NEAR STAGE DOOR
The DIRECTOR is pacing up and down the corridor. NORM is also walking up and down, SHAKE is leaning against the wall quite unconcerned. NORM gives SHAKE a push.
NORM
Worry, will you!
SHAKE adjusts his features to a worrying expression.
DIRECTOR
(bitterly)
Well, that's it, two minutes to the final run-through... they're bound to miss it...
NORM
I'll murder that Lennon.
DIRECTOR
But I suppose we can survive a missed run-through as long...
SHAKE
... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.
NORM
Shurrup, cheerful.
The horrible prospect hits the DIRECTOR.
DIRECTOR
You don't think...
NORM
(rea**uring him)
They'll be here.
DIRECTOR
Oh now, they can't do that to me.
(turning on Norm)
It's all your fault.
(overriding Norm)
Oh yes it is and if they don't turn up I wouldn't be in your shoes for all the...
SHAKE
(helping out)
... tea in China. Oh you're right, neither would I.
He steps away from NORM and stands near the DIRECTOR.
NORM
Traitor!
SHAKE nods his agreement to this a**essment of his character.
SHAKE
Of course.
At this moment JOHN, GEORGE and PAUL enter from the stage door. They are completely unconcerned and walk past the DIRECTOR, SHAKE and NORM.
JOHN
(as he pa**es by)
Hi Norm!
NORM
(preoccupied)
Hi, our lot!
The BOYS walk on when after a moment NORM snaps to.
NORM
Our lot!
GEORGE
(mildly)
Did you want something.
NORM
(beaming with delight)
I could eat the lot of you.
JOHN
You'd look gear with an apple in your gob.
DIRECTOR
(accusingly)
Do you realise you could have missed the final run-through?
GEORGE
Sorry.
SHAKE
Eh, there's only three of them.
PAUL
Aye, we were looking for Ringo. But we realised he must have come back.
DIRECTOR
Do you realise we are on the air, live, in front of an audience, in forty-five minutes and you're one short.
JOHN
Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.
NORM
Aye, let's try the dressing room.
Everyone starts along the pa**age. NORM and PAUL last.
PAUL
Eh, where's my grandfather?
NORM
Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
PAUL
Aye, I suppose so.
They run after the others.
78. EXTERIOR T.V. THEATRE CLOSE-UP
GRANDFATHER
Here they are, personally signed and handwritten by your own sweet boys. The chance of a lifetime. Be the envy of your less fortunate sisters!
The CAMERA PULLS back and we see GRANDFATHER is surrounded by girls who have broken from the queue and are doing a brisk trade with the old man. He has a large sign on which is written: "Get your genuine autographed Beatles photographs." On the edge of the crowd two POLICEMEN are trying to force the girls back into the queue. Finally they wade through the girls and confront GRANDFATHER. They look at the old man quizzically; he stares back coldly. They indicate he should hop it and quick but GRANDFATHER defiantly glares back at them. So with a sigh, they grab an arm each and escort the old man off.
79. INTERIOR POLICE STATION
It is the reception desk and behind it is the DESK SERGEANT. After a moment RINGO is dragged in by the POLICEMAN we saw him with before.
RINGO
Look, I'm Ringo Starr... I've got a show to do in a few minutes you've got to let me go... I'm Ringo...
POLICEMAN
Sure, they all say that these days ... Anyway ... I don't care who you are... you can save that for the stipendary. Here you are, Sarge.
SERGEANT
What is he?
POLICEMAN
(reeling off the list)
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
SERGEANT
Oh, a little savage, is he?
POLICEMAN
A proper Aborigine.
RINGO
(on his dignity)
I demand to see me solicitor.
SERGEANT
What's his name?
RINGO
Oh, well if you're going to get technical --
At that moment there is a loud series of noises off camera, furious shouting and dull crashes of wood.
SERGEANT
Hello, it's going to be one of those nights, is it?
(to policeman)
Sit Charley Peace down over there.
The POLICEMAN takes RINGO to a bench and sits him down as GRANDFATHER and the two POLICEMEN who were with him enter. The sign is tattered and is being lugged after them.
GRANDFATHER
Well, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me.
(kicks the nearest policeman)
Oh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still.
SERGEANT
Is there a fire, then?
GRANDFATHER leans across the desk and hisses at the SERGEANT.
GRANDFATHER
You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
SERGEANT
Eh?
GRANDFATHER
I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.
SERGEANT
What's he on about?
GRANDFATHER
(squaring up)
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
SERGEANT
(to policemen)
Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
The POLICEMEN hurtle GRANDFATHER firmly but gently over to the bench on which RINGO is sitting and then return to the desk for a whispered conference with the SERGEANT. Meanwhile in full conspiratorial fashion GRANDFATHER talks to RINGO out of the side of his mouth.
GRANDFATHER
Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?
RINGO
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
GRANDFATHER
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
RINGO
What?
GRANDFATHER
(whispering)
Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
RINGO
(disturbed)
Have they?
GRANDFATHER
That sergeant's a body-blow veteran if ever I measured one. One of us has got to escape. I'll get the boys. Hold on son, I'll be back for you.
RINGO
(horrified)
Me!
GRANDFATHER
And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
RINGO
(hopefully)
Oh, they seem all right to me.
GRANDFATHER
That's what they want you to think. All coppers are villains.
SERGEANT
(calling)
Would you two like a cup of tea?
GRANDFATHER
You see, sly villains.
RINGO
(miserable)
No thanks, Mr. Sergeant, sir.
We now have a CLOSE SHOT of POLICEMEN around the sergeant's desk.
SERGEANT
So you just brought the old chap out of the crowd for his own good.
POLICEMAN
Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.
SERGEANT
Well, he can't stop here.
Shot of GRANDFATHER watching POLICEMEN intently and muttering words as he does.
RINGO
What are you doing?
GRANDFATHER
Lip reading.
RINGO
What are they saying?
GRANDFATHER
Nothing good.
The POLICEMEN make a move towards GRANDFATHER and RINGO.
GRANDFATHER
Well son, it's now or never.
He jumps to his feet and scurries towards the door.
GRANDFATHER
All right, you paid a**a**ins. Johnny McCartney'll give you a run for your threepence ha'penny.
He dashes out of the door followed by the POLICEMAN who has his pile of photos.
SERGEANT
Now, what's he up to?
RINGO
He's allergic to Bobbies, especially English Bobbies.
The POLICEMAN with the photos returns.
POLICEMAN
(Irish accent)
Your man disappeared like a leveret over a hill.
RINGO
Turncoat!
The POLICEMEN turn on RINGO and walk towards him.
CLOSE-UP RINGO
RINGO
Mother!
80. EXTERIOR STREET
GRANDFATHER is running at top speed down the street. He is breathing heavily and runs as if pursued by the hounds of hell. The street however is entirely empty and no one is even in sight. As he reaches the top of the street he pauses and turning, looks around him. From his P.O.V. we see just how empty the street is and heaving a sigh of relief GRANDFATHER cackles to himself. His triumph is short lived. At this precise moment down the street comes a parade of police vehicles, a Black Maria, an escorting police motor bike patrol and an ordinary squad car. The procession draws up and the street is full of policemen getting out of the Black Maria and squad car and off motor bikes.
CLOSE-UP GRANDFATHER's horrified face.
GRANDFATHER
Be God, they've called up reinforcements, the dragnet's out!
He dashes off wildly in the general direction of the theatre. He has been completely unnoticed by the policemen who are lining up for a last minute inspection by the inspector in charge. The inspector is like a commander-in-chief of a spear-head attack force.
They smartly march off in the direction taken by GRANDFATHER.
81. INTERIOR T.V. THEATRE CONTROL ROOM
DIRECTOR
(watching the clock)
Only half an hour and you're on!
GEORGE
Can I say something?
The director clutches at any straw.
DIRECTOR
(hopefully)
Yes, anything.
GEORGE
(earnestly)
It's highly unlikely we'll be on... I mean the law of averages are against you and it seems that, etc., etc....
But his speech is drowned by the pitiful moans of the DIRECTOR.
82. EXTERIOR T.V. THEATRE STAGE DOOR
The four little boys from the can*l are being driven away by the
security guard.
GUARD
(going back into theatre)
I'll have the hides off of you lot.
The kids retreat as GRANDFATHER pants into shot, ignoring the kids he enters the stage door but in a second he is out again, grasped firmly by the collar by the security guard.
GUARD
You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Go home!
GRANDFATHER
I must see Pauly.
GUARD
Go home then and see him on the telly.
The GUARD re-enters the stage door.
GRANDFATHER looks around him and sees the four kids. He hustles over and after a whispered conference we hear his offer.
GRANDFATHER
Can you fix him for me?
BOYS
Yeah.
GRANDFATHER
Sixpence.
BOY
Each?
GRANDFATHER is about to argue.
GRANDFATHER
Oh, all right.
BOY
And in advance.
GRANDFATHER
(disgusted)
Mercenary!
But he hands over the money. The kids rush in the stage door and after a moment the furious GUARD chases them out and down the alley. GRANDFATHER, chuckling, nips in the door.
83. INTERIOR T.V. CONTROL ROOM ON STAGE
GRANDFATHER is being chased by several studio attendants; he is dodging behind equipment. He finally gets on a sound boom trolley and uses it as a weapon to keep his pursuers at bay.
84. INTERIOR T.V. CONTROL ROOM
The DIRECTOR, BOYS, and NORM and SHAKE see GRANDFATHER on the monitors. They dash out of the room and on to the stage.
DIRECTOR
(shouting)
It's all right, leave him alone.
PAUL
Grandad, where's Ringo?
GRANDFATHER
The police have the poor unfortunate lad in the Bridewell.
BOYS
The police station.
GRANDFATHER
He'll be pulp by now.
JOHN
What are we waiting for?
GEORGE
Come here.
PAUL, JOHN and GEORGE rush off.
CLOSE-UP DIRECTOR
DIRECTOR
We've only got twenty minutes.
85. EXTERIOR STREET OUTSIDE POLICE STATION
PAUL, JOHN and GEORGE come running down the street in single file, their knees high in the air, they skid to a halt at the police station and without pausing they dash inside. After a moment they reappear -- only this time RINGO is behind them. They dash off down the street. They are followed at once by ten POLICEMEN also in single file. They are also pounding along knees high in the air. The BOYS and the coppers disappear around the corner. At once, they reappear from the other direction, then run down the street still followed by the policemen. When they reach the police station another group of police bars their way so they are forced to run up the stairs and inside.
86. INTERIOR POLICE STATION
The DESK SERGEANT is standing behind his desk looking very surprised. At this moment the boys run in and stand panting in front of the desk. Before the SERGEANT can start speaking the pursuing POLICEMEN arrive. They, too, are out of breath.
SERGEANT
What is all this?
JOHN
(heaving and panting)
Hold on until we get our breath.
The BOYS and POLICEMEN pant on until JOHN seems to have recovered.
SERGEANT
All right now?
JOHN
Sure.
(to boys)
Ready?
The BOYS nod and without further ado they turn and run through the surprised rank of POLICEMEN and out into the street.
87. EXTERIOR STREET
THE CHASE CARRIES ON.
Shots of BOYS being pursued (still in single file) by police, including the sergeant with one shot where the BOYS are chasing the POLICEMEN. Finally, as they approach the theatre, they are seen by the girl fans who swarm around the police, over running them. The boys grin to each other and are about to make off when from their P.O.V. we see the INSPECTOR and POLICEMEN blocking it.
JOHN
Ah well, it was worth a try.
INSPECTOR
(calling to Sergeant)
What do you think you're up to?
SERGEANT
Arrest those boys, sir.
INSPECTOR
That's all we need to start a real riot!
(to Boys)
Come on lads, they're waiting for you.
### INTERIOR THEATRE BACKSTAGE
The Inspector now hustles the BOYS through the crowds and in through the main entrance of the theatre where SHAKE and NORM are waiting. NORM looks suspiciously at RINGO who is still wearing his cap. RINGO whips it off and NORM delightedly hugs him. The BOYS dash through the stalls entrance and on stage. The DIRECTOR sees them and bursts into tears with relief. NORM hustles the lads into the wings to be changed into their show costumes. All around them last-minute preparations are going on.
DIRECTOR
Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.
NORM
Aren't you supposed to be in that box?
The DIRECTOR gives NORM a final glare and dashes off.
PAUL
And another thing, where's that old mixer?
GRANDFATHER
Here, Pauly.
And sitting on a box sadly chastened sits GRANDFATHER.
PAUL
Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.
JOHN
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
PAUL
(hotly)
What's old got to do with it?
JOHN
You needn't bother.
PAUL
Y'what?
JOHN
Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
PAUL
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
JOHN
That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?
From JOHN's P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER. He looks what he is, a tired old man.
JOHN
You see.
(to Grandad)
You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.
GRANDFATHER
(fighting back)
But I'm clean.
The BOYS giggle and slap him on the back.
88. INTERIOR TV THEATRE AUDITORIUM
We see the audience of girls streaming in and settling down in their places for the show. There is the usual business of getting the show ready and we see SHOTS of the girls' faces, then JOHN, PAUL, RINGO and GEORGE looking at them. At last on cue from the floor manager the BOYS start their act to the audience's screams. During the number we constantly CUT away to the audience with various SHOTS of the ecstatic girls. In the middle of these shots we see NORM standing at the side of the audience his face glowing with satisfaction. We follow his gaze and from NORM'S P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER handcuffed to SHAKE, but in spite of this, the old man is enjoying himself. The BOYS now perform a medley of numbers, i.e., a little of all the songs we have heard during the story. This gives the impression of a full set and we finish after their bows. While they are doing so they look again in the general direction of SHAKE and GRANDFATHER and from their P.O.V., we see SHAKE is beating time to the music but from his wrist dangles an empty set of handcuffs. GRANDFATHER has gone again. As the BOYS are reacting to GRANDFATHER's disappearance once again, the trap door on the stage opens and GRANDFATHER appears in the centre of the group as they finish their act and take their final bows.
89. INTERIOR STUDIO CORRIDOR
NORM is waiting for the boys. With him are two studio attendants carrying the boys' luggage. As the BOYS excitedly appear he speaks to hem.
NORM
I've got the stuff. Come here.
PAUL
Aren't we ...
NORM
No, we're not!
He hurries them along.
NORM
The office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.
JOHN
Tonight? We can't make it ...
NORM
You've got a midnight matinee.
JOHN
Now, look here, Norm ...
NORM
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
JOHN
What?
NORM
You're a swine. So hurry up ... we're travelling!
NORM turns down a side exit where the door is open to the field. In it is an eight-pa**enger helicopter.
90. EXTERIOR STAGE DOOR T.V. THEATRE
The BOYS and NORM come out of the building and start to run towards the helicopter.
PAUL
(looking behind him)
Where's my grandfather?
NORM
(arriving at helicopter door)
Don't start. Look.
The boys look in the pa**enger bay and there is GRANDFATHER. He is still handcuffed to SHAKE but clutching his pile of photos.
GRANDFATHER
(beckoning them in with his free hand which holds the photos)
Come on, you're hanging up the parade.
The boys shout "Get rid of those things, etc."
91. EXTERIOR FIELD
The final shot is of the helicopter rising up (SHOT FROM BELOW). As it disappears, a shower of photos come from its window.
We cut to a CLOSE-UP of one signed photo as it hits the ground and SUPER the closing credits over it.




[Speech]
[Rodney Burke:] Now, for the final number, John's got a card in his hand with a little rhyme on it. What is it?
[John:] It's from the form up a third at Hemel Hempstead.
[Rodney:] Oh!
[John:] It says, "Dear George, John, Ringo, Paul, here's hoping that you'll please us all. A beauty song and swinging voice, we leave it up to you, the choice. We think you're fab and really cool, so brighten up our lads at school." Dig this, for here's Paul, whistling "Clarabella".
All I've got is a picture of you
Now that you've gone and left me blue
You don't hear me cry at night
And say sweet things to you
You don't hear me sing a love song to
A picture of you
I pretend that you're still here with me
Laughing just the way we used to be
But pictures they can't talk and they can't see



I know I'm in love and nothing more
Nothing more
I hope you'll be happy where you are
But if you need me I won't be to far
Standing in the shadow of my dreams
They say it's not as bad as it may seem
But they don't lie awake at night and cry the way I do
They don't realise that all I got
Is a picture of you
Well, if your hands start a-clappin'
And your fingers start a-poppin'
And your feet start a-movin' around
And if you start to swing and sway
When the band starts to play
A real cool way out sound
And if you get to can't help it and you can't sit down
You feel like you gotta move around
You get a shot of rhythm and blues.
With just a little rock and roll on the side
Just for good measure.
Get a pair of dancin' shoes
Well, with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're gonna have a rockin' time, c'mon!
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
If you start to dance and sing
And chills come up on you
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too
Well, here's something for you to do
Get a shot of rhythm and blues
With just a little rock and roll on the side



Just for good measure
Get a pair of dancin' shoes
Well, with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're gonna have a rockin' time, c'mon!
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
If you start to dance and sing
And chills come up on you
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too
Well, here's something for you to do
Get a shot of rhythm and blues
Get a pair of dancin' shoes
Get a shot of rhythm and blues
Well, with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're gonna have a rockin' time, c'mon!
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
If you start to dance and sing
And chills come up on you
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too
Well, here's something for you to do
Well, here's something for you to do
Well, here's something for you to do

A taste of honey

I dream of your first kiss and then
I feel upon my lips again
A taste of honey

I will return, yes I will return



I'll come back for the honey, and you
Yours was a kiss that awoke my heart

For the honey, for the honey
And you

You Never Give Me Your Money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations you break down
I never give you my number
I only give my situation
And in the middle of investigation I break down
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But, oh, that magic feeling
Nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling
Nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
Ah Ah Ah
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Came true today
Yes it did (na, na)

Mean Mr. Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark, tryin to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy him some clothes
Keeps a ten bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in the shop
She never stops; she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene

She's so good-looking, but she looks like a man
Well, you should see her in drag
Dressed in her polythene bag
Yes, you should see Polythene Pam
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's k**er-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl



Who makes the News Of The World
Yes, you could say that she's attractively built
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(John) She's coming in the house
(Paul) Oh, look out!
She Came In Through The Bathroom Window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she s**s her thumb and wonders
By the banks of her own lagoon
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal, but she could not rob
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
Oh, yeah
Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep, pretty darling; do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
Golden Slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles awake you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby.
Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep, pretty darling; do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Sunrise doesn't last all morning

Seems my love is up and has left you with no warning
It's not always been this gray
All things must pa**
All things must pa** away
Sunset doesn't last all evening
A mind can blow those clouds away
After all this, my love is up and must be leaving
It's not always been this gray
All things must pa**
All things must pa** away 



All things must pa**
None of life's dreams can last
So, I must be on my way
To face another day
Now darkness only stays the nighttime
In the morning, it will fade away
Daylight is good at arriving at the right time
It's not always gonna be this gray
All things must pa**
All things must pa** away
All things must pa**
All things must pa** away

Tell me that you've got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you don't get me
You don't get me
You say you've seen seven wonders
And your bird is green
But you can't see me
You can't see me
When your prized possessions
Start to weigh you down
Look in my direction 



I'll be 'round
I'll be 'round
When your bird is broken
Will it bring you down?
You may be awoken
I'll be 'round
I'll be 'round
You tell me that you heard every sound there is
And your bird can swing
But you can't hear me
You can't hear me
You tell me that you've got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you don't get me, you don't get me
You say you've seen seven wonders and your bird is green
But you can't see me, you can't see me
When your prized possessions start to wear you down
Look in my direction, i'll be round, i'll be round



When your bird is broken will it bring you down
You may be awoken, i'll be round, i'll be round
You tell me that you've heard every sound there is
And your bird can swim
But you can't hear me, you can't hear me

(All): (Singing) Jingle bells...
(P): Hello, everybody, this is Paul, and I'd just like to thank you all for buying our records during the past year. We know you've been buying 'em because the sales have been very good, you see. Don't know where we'd be without you, really though.
(J): In the army, perhaps.
(P): Oh, we hope you've enjoyed listening to the records as much as we've enjoyed melting them - No, no, no, that's worng. - making them. We're in No. 2 studio at the moment, at EMI, taping this little message for you.
(J): Yes, we are.
(P): We are indeed. I just thought I'd make that... This is the same studio we've used all along - since the old days of "Love Me Do" - many years ago it seems, doesn't it?
(J): Ah, those were the days ...
(P): Well, that's about all, I think. Except, to wish you all a Happy Christmas and a very New Year! Now I'll pa** you over to John. John!
(J): John. John speakin'. Thanks all of you who bought me book. Thank you folks for buying it. It was very handy. And there's another one out pretty soon, it says here. Hope you buy that, too. It'll be the usual rubbish but it won't cost much. You see, that's the bargain we're going to strike up. I write them in my spare time, it says here. It's been a busy year ....
(P): Did you write this yourself?
(J): No! It's somebody's bad handwriter. It's been a busy year Beatle peadles, one way and another. But it's been a great year, too. You fans have seen to that. Page 2. Thanks a lot folks and a hap-py, ah, Christmas and a merry goo-year. Crimble maybe. And I'll hand you to George who will speak to you - now!
(G): Thank you John. Thank you. Hi there! I'd like to thank all of you for going to see the film. 'spect a lot of you saw it more than once.
(R): I did.
(G): Did you? So did I. Thanks anyway. 'Cause it makes us very pleased, ya know. We had a quiet time making it. Actually, we didn't. We had a great time making it. And we're glad it turned out okay. The next one should be completely different. We start shooting it in February. This time it's gonna be in color. 



(J): Green.
(G): It'll be a big laugh we hope. (Ha ha ha!) Well, we ... Big laugh, ha ha ha, yeah, it'll be a big laugh.
(J): Be a big laugh, you imagine?
(G): And we may see all of you soon. Hope so anyway. All the best. And, happy New Year. And a Happy Christmas. And here's Ringo.
(R): Thanks, Geroge. Ringo here. Well, the others have thanked you for all the discs and John's book and for everything - oh, no - for enjoying the film. I'd like to thank you just for being fans. It's been a funny year, you know. One minute we're in England, next, we're away. 'spect you're wondering where we've been. Well, Beatle people, we've been to Australia and America and New (Who's dropping that?) New Zealand. And Australia.
(P): And New Zealand.
(R): Ha ha! Or is that New Zealand?
(P): So much travelling! But you've stayed loyal, haven't you?
(R): Anyway, those airport receptions knocked us out, man, great!
(J): Dig!
(R): Well, that's about it from me. I'd just like to say, all the best for Christmas and happy new year.
(All) (Singing):
Oh, can you wash your father's shirt,
Can you wash it clean?
Oh, can you wash your father's shirt,
Can you wash it clean?
Oh, can you wash your father's shirt,
Can you wash it clean? Oo
Christmas! (Happy Christmas, everybody!)
Happy Christmas!
Happy Christmas!
Happy Christmas!
Happy Christmas! Yeah!
Happy Christmas!
Happy Christmas!
(J): Christmas!
(P): Happy Christmas!
(All): Happy Christmas! Happy Christmas! Chrismas!
Happy Christmas!

I'm back in the u.s.s.r.
You don't know how lucky you are boy
Back in the u.s.s.r.
Well the ukraine girls really knock me out



They leave the west behind
And moscow girls make me sing and shout
That georgia's always on my mind.
I'm back in the u.s.s.r.
You don't know how lucky you are boys
Back in the u.s.s.r.
Show me round your snow peaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddy's farm
Let me hear your balalaika's ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm.
I'm back in the u.s.s.r.
You don't know how lucky you are boys
Back in the u.s.s.r.

[Intro]
A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He won't do nothing right, just sitting down and looks so good
He don't want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts chewing gum in little girl's hair
Hey, junior, behave yourself
Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he gets (oh) is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night she's ready to poop
From rocking and a-rolling to spinning in a hula hoop



Well this rock and roll has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
Ooh!
[Bridge]
Ooh!
Gonna tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbor's cat
You gave the co*ker spaniel a bath in mother's laundromat
Well, in mama's head it's got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
[Outro]
We all miss you; You miss them?
Yeah!
The Beatles miss you; all the Beatles missed you
Now, junior, behave yourself
A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He won't do nothing right just sitting down and looks so good
He don't want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts some gum in little girl's hair
Hey, junior, behave yourself
Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night she's ready to poop



From rocking and a-rolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
Going tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbors cat
You gave the co*ker spaniel a bath in mother's laundramat
Well, mama's head has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself

If you ever leave me, I'll be sad and blue
Don't you ever leave me, I'm so in love with you
The birds in the sky would be sad and lonely
If they knew that I lost my one and only
They'd be sad if you're bad to me
The leaves on the trees would be softly sighing
If they heard from the breeze that you left me crying
They'd be sad, don't be bad to me



But I know you won't leave me 'cos you told me so
And I've no intention of letting you go
Just as long as you let me know, you won't be bad to me
So the birds in the sky won't be sad and lonely
'Cos they know I got my one and only
They'll be glad you're not bad to me
They'll be glad you're not bad to me, to me, to me
Well

Step right this way!
Roll up
Roll up for the mystery tour
Roll up
Roll up for the mystery tour
The magical mystery tour is waiting to take you away
Waiting to take you away, take you today
There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need
Everywhere people stare
Each and ev'ry day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say
Hey, you've got to hide your love away!
Hey, you've got to hide your love away!
Oho, I never realised what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see?



Can't you see?
That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me to, ohohoho, oho
And when I ask you to be mine, ahaha
You're gonna say you love me too
It's been a hard days night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard days night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
Oh!
I think I'm gonna be sad
I think it's today, yeah!
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
And she don't care
Jo-Jo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jo-Jo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California gra**
Get back!
Get back!
Beautiful dreamer, wake unto me
Starlight and dewdrops are awaiting thee
Sounds of the rude world heard in the day
Led by the moonlight have all pa**ed away
Beautiful dreamer, queen of my song
List while I woo the with soft melody
Gone are the cares of life's busy throng
Beautiful dreamer awake unto me
Beautiful dreamer awake unto me!



Beautiful dreamer, out on the sea
Mermaids are chaunting the wild lorelei
Over the streamlet vapors are borne
Waiting to fade at the bright coming morn
Beautiful dreamer, beam on my heart
E'en as the morn on the streamlet and sea
Then will all clouds of sorrow depart
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!
Because the world is round it turns me on
Because the world is round...aaaaaahhhhhh
Because the wind is high it blows my mind
Because the wind is high......aaaaaaaahhhh



Love is all, love is new
Love is all, love is you
Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue.......aaaaaaaahhhh
Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh....

Wake up in the morning I don't feel blue
'Cause I know I got you
Get a funny feeling all day and night
I get the funny feeling you don't treat me right
Should have read your letters
And then I'd know
I would have felt much better
Because I know you love me so

Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play 



Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away

Oh carol, don't let him
Steal your heart away.
Well i've got to learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day.
Well come into my machine
So we can move on out.
I know a jumping little joint
Where we can jump and shout.
It's not too far back on the highway
Not too long a ride.
You take your car along
And you park it outside.
A little cutie takes your hat
And you can thank her, ma'am,
'cos every time you're gonna drive,
You find the joint is jammed.
Oh carol, don't let him
Steal your heart away.
Well i've got to learn to dance



If it takes me all night and day. auw.
Well if you want to hear some music
Like the boys all play,
Hold tight, tap your foot,
Don't let it carry you away.
Don't let the heat overcome you
'cos they play so loud
While the music will treat you

On the road to Rishikesh

And the dream I had was true
Yes, the dream I had was true
I'm just a child of nature

As I face the desert skies
And my thoughts return to home
Yes, my thoughts return to home

Touch the windows of my soul
Touch the windows of my soul
I'm just a child of nature
I don't need much to set me free
I'm just a child of nature
I'm one of nature's children

[Brian Matthew:] The next few minutes, we're in the lap of the gods and the hands of the Beatles. In my young days, when I was a lad, they used to have actors in films and now that they--
[Paul:] Yes?
[John:] Hey! Listen!
[Paul:] It's all changed, now, Brian. They're not doing that, no actors.
[John:] It's all changed, now.
[Brian:] But this is what I wonder. In those days, the actors used to say their best bits were left on the cutting room floor. Did you find that?
[John:] No, no, no, those were the good bits in the film. You should have seen the rest.
[Brian:] Yes?
[John:] Rubbish!
[Brian:] Was it, really?
[John:] Even worse, yes.
[Brian:] Who was worst?
[John:] Oh, Paul.
[Brian:] I see.
[Paul:] I think John was about the worst.
[John:] No, it was you.
[Paul:] Oh, Ringo was very good. He was. He's a good lad.
[Brian:] He was. They're saying he's a new Charlie Chaplin. Do you think that's right?



[John:] He was miming.
[Paul:] You, too, with Jason.
[John:] Oh, yes, he's an old one. Okay, Ring?
[Brian:] Beginning to look like that. Now, then--
[Ringo:] All right, John. Can you hear me?
[Paul:] Can you hear him? Hello!
[Brian:] Not really. I hope not. I hope not!
[John:] We brought you the flowers, Ring.
[Brian:] He's not allowed to talk.
[Ringo:] Eh?
[John:] We brought you the flowers.
[Ringo:] Oh, good.
[John:] And the grapes.
[Ringo:] Oh, I like grapes.
[Paul:] He likes grapes.
[George:] We've been to Portugal.
[Brian:] Guess who's, guess who's top of the pops in Portugal, then.
[All:] Who?
[Brian:] Los Beatles.
[John:] Los Beatles? Great, great laugh.
[Brian:] I don't suppose you know the title of your film in Portuguese?
[John:] No. Crinsk dee Night?
[Brian:] Could be. Let's hear the number, shall we?
[John:] Right.

Since she's been gone
I want no one
To talk to me
It's not the same
But I'm to blame
It's plain to see
So go away and leave me alone

You never wear a suit of lace,
The powder's not on your face.
You're always wearing jeans
Except on sunday.
So please don't ever change,
No don't you ever change.
I kind of like you
Just the way you are.
You don't know the latest dance,
But when it's time to make romance
Your kisses let me know
You're not a tomboy.
So please don't ever change,
No don't you ever change.
Promise you're always gonna be
As sweet as you are.
I love you when you're happy,



I love you when you're blue.
I love you when you're mad at me,
So how can i get tired of you?
A lots of other girls i've seen,
They know how to treat guys mean.
But you would rather die
Than ever hurt me.
So please don't ever change,
No don't you ever change.
Just promise you're always gonna be
As sweet as you are.
Please don't ever change,
Don't you ever change.
Please don't ever change,

I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive.
Listen for your footsteps
But they don't arrive.
Waiting for your knock, dear
On my old front door.
I don't hear it,
Does it mean you don't love me anymore?
I hear the clock a'ticking,
On the mantel shelf.
See the hands a'moving,
But I'm by myself.
I wonder where you are tonight,
And why I'm by myself.
I don't see you,
Does it mean you don't love me anymore?
Don't pa** me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue.
'Cause you know darling, I love only you.
You'll never know it hurt me so,
I hate to see you go.
Don't pa** me by, don't make me cry.




I'm sorry that I doubted you,
I was so unfair.
You were in a car crash,
And you lost your hair.
You said that you would be late
About an hour or two.
I said, "That's alright, I'm waiting here,
Just waiting to hear from you".
Don't pa** me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue.
'Cause you know darling, I love only you.
You'll never know it hurt me so,
I hate to see you go.

INTERVIEWER: Do you think the bug has bitten now? Are you guys – do you have big eyes now to be actors?
PAUL: No.
GEORGE: Not really, no. We still, you know, even if our film – this, A Hard Day's Night – is the biggest box office attraction ever, you know, it still won't make us feel as though we're actors. But I think we'd all enjoy making a new film.
RINGO: Yeah, it's good fun. I think the next one we make will be more fun, because we've sort of got the hang of things. Like on this one, when we first started, when we're not supposed to look at the camera, you'd always sort of find yourself turning ‘round and smiling at it. [laughs] You'd just smile as soon as you saw the camera, you know.
PAUL: And on this one, I don't know whether this happens on lots of films, we used to keep breaking up giggling.
RINGO: Yeah.
PAUL: We had some great giggling fits, you know. We'd sort of say a line, and I kept doing it a particular way. There was one line I kept saying to Ringo, it's about the grandfather in the film who goes off to—
RINGO: Well, we can't tell you, ‘cause we'll ruin the film, you see!
PAUL: We can't tell you [inaudible] but it was just this one thing where the grandfather goes off to a club, and I was supposed to say to Ringo “It's all your fault” and things. ‘Cause in the film actually, although it's not true in real life, we sort of pick on Ringo a bit, you know, because it was obvious really, because he's sort of smaller and it looks funny in the film. But I'm supposed to be picking on Ringo and saying “It's all your fault” and things. And as I was saying it, I'm a bit – I kept flapping my arms up and down, I don't know why, I must have thought I was a good actor! [laughter] And I was just sort of flapping around and saying, “It's all your fault!” [sound of arms flapping; laughs] Flapping my arms around, and he couldn't stand it, he was giggling away. So then I started laughing, and we just collapsed, and we took so many takes on that bit.



RINGO: Yeah, twelve takes on that bit.
PAUL: Yeah. And I think we cut that bit in the end or something. [laughs]
RINGO: Yeah.
PAUL: They cut some of it.
RINGO: They cut half of it, yeah, but you know, a lot of laughs. All different things that happened were funny to us which, you know, they haven't printed or put on the film, but it's great when we go and see the film, then we can sort of say, “Remember that bit?” if they showed the one we did before, you know, where we all broke up.
Falling in love again, for the love we share
As you hear me say "I adore you."
I'm falling in love again, oh, my darling, it seems
All my darling it seems, I love you
All our romances would never go astray
My love is your love, forever and a day
Falling in love again, paradise right here



I love that you're my dear, I love you
(Instrumental break)
Falling in love again, for the love we share
As you hear me say "I adore you."
Falling in love again, paradise right here

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong
I'm right where I belong
I'm right where I belong
See the people standing there
Who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door
I'm painting the room in a colourful way
And when my mind is wandering 



There I will go
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong
I'm right where I belong
I'm right where I belong
Silly people run around
They worry me and never ask me
Why they don't get past my door
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
Where it will go
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where will it go
I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where will it go
And it really doesn't matter if i'm wrong
I'm right
Where i belong i'm right
Where i belong.
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door.
I'm painting my room in the colourful way



And when my mind is wandering
There i will go.
And it really doesn't matter if
I'm wrong i'm right
Where i belong i'm right
Where i belong.
Silly people run around they worry me
And never ask me why they don't get past my door.
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And i still go.
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go.

Ahhhhhhh
one day, you'll look
To see i've gone.
But tomorrow may rain, so i'll follow the sun.
Someday, you'll know
I was the one.
But tomorrow may rain, so i'll follow the sun.
And now the time has come,
And so, my love, i must go.
And though i loose a friend,
In the end you will know.
One day, you'll find
That i have gone.

Your day breaks
Your mind aches
You find that all her words
Of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you
She wakes up
She makes up
She takes her time
And doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years
You want her
You need her
And yet you don't believe her
When she says her love is dead
You think she needs you
And in her eyes you see nothing 



No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years
You stay home
She goes out
She says that long ago
She knew someone
But now he's gone
She doesn't need him
Your day breaks
Your mind aches
There will be times
When all the things she said
Will fill your head
You won't forget her
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years
Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all the words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you
She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!
You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her when she said her love is dead
You think she needs you
And in her eyes you see nothing



No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!
You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone
She doesn't need him
Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be time when all the things she said will fil your head
You won't forget her
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird I'll fly
As a bird on wings
Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so...
Free as a bird
Like the next best thing to be



Free as a bird
Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird I'll fly
As a bird on wings
Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Always made me feel so free
Ah...
Ah...
Ah...
Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Oooooo

[Turn out nice again, mother.]
Free as a bird,
It's the next best thing to be free as a bird.
Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird i fly, as a bird on wings
Whatever happened to the life that we once knew
Can we really live without each other
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much
It always made me feel so



Free as a bird,
It's the next best thing to be free as a bird.
Home home and dry
Like a homing bird i fly--a bird on wing
Whatever happened to the life that we once knew
Always made me feel soooo
Free
Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Free as a bird

My temperature is low,
Fever is high,

I'm too weak.
Well come on honey bonnie,
Give me one more time.
Everytime you do
Well i feel glad all over.

Boy you're gonna carry that weight,
carry that weight for a long time
Boy you're gonna carry that weight,
carry that weight for a long time
I never give you my pillow,
I only send you my invitations
And in the middle of the celebrations,



I break down
Boy you're gonna carry that weight,
carry that weight for a long time
Boy you're gonna carry that weight,
carry that weight for a long time
Oh yeah, all right,
are you gonna be in my dreams tonight?
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
And in the end,
the love you take,
is equal to the love you make,
Ah
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
I need to laugh
And when the sun is out
I've got something I can laugh about
I feel good
In a special way
I'm in love and it's a sunny day
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
We take a walk
The sun is shining down
Burns my feet as they touch the ground
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine 



Then we lie
Beneath the shady tree
I love her and she's loving me
She feels good (she does)
She knows she's looking fine
I'm so proud to know that she is mine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
(Good day, sunshine)
(Good day, sunshine)
(Good day, sunshine)

Good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine
I need to laugh and when the sun is out
I've got something i can laugh about
I feel good in a special way
I'm in love and it's a sunny day
Good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine
We take a walk, the sun is shining down
Burns my feet as they touch the ground



Good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine
Then we'd lie beneath the shady tree
I love her and she's loving me
She feels good, she knows she's looking fine
I'm so proud to know that she is mine.
Good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine

Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day how's your boy been
Nothing to do it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's okay
Good morning, good morning
Going to work don't want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep.
And you're on your own you're in the street
Good morning, good morning
After a while you start to smile now you feel cool.



Then you decide to take a walk by the old school.
Nothing has changed it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's okay
Good morning, good morning
People running round it's five o'clock.
Everywhere in town is getting dark.
Everyone you see is full of life.
It's time for tea and meet the wife.
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here.
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear.
Go to a show you hope she goes.
I've got nothing to say but it's okay
Good morning, good morning

Ah, ha, ha, hi

I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life
You didn't run, you didn't hide
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again for I had told you
Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day
Got to get you into my life
What can I do, what can I be



When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true I'll never leave
And if I do I know the way there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life
Got to get you into my life
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you

You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew i wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time we'd meet again
For i had told you
Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and i want you hear me
Say we'll be together every day
Got to get you into my life

[Intro]
Yesterday was today
The 29th of May
18 years of age
Thought I'd never see that day
Hol' up.. Wait
Suddenly, it's all starting to hit me
Why we have to go? I don't know
I guess just a part of life
And we all gotta grow
Old, Woah
[Hook]
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they are here to stay
Oh I believe, in yesterday!
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they are here to stay
Oh I believe, in yesterday!
[Verse 1]
Loki
Highschool ruled, thought I'd never leave
So many memories, thinkin back It's k**in' me!
So softy. Mommy please stop me
From maturing, I am in no hurry
Why am I so worried?
My futures kinda blurry
My feelings kinda mixed up
Like a mcflurry!
No words can explain
Just how I feel
Oh so much pain
The feelings so unreal
Life is but a game
It's time to spin the wheel
Do you feel the same?
Or is this no big deal?
sh** keeps gettin real!



Loki how ya feel?
Bittersweet
140 characters couldn't fit it in a tweet
I love the cla** of 13
Retweet!
All you undercla** men hit favorite
Cause we just graduated..
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Cla** of thirteen
Up on the big screen
Ragers we threw were like a project x scene
We're just a bunch of teens
Who fein for untamed dreams
Cause reality, isn't what it seems
Life is too short
So I never hold a grudge
Were all very different doesn't mean you gotta judge
When push come to shove
It's all peace and love
No fight club
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now i need a place to hide away
Oh i believe in yesterday
Why she had to go i dont know
She wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now i long for yesterday
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now im about to graduate
Hol' up...wait
Aye
Its the Graduation song
[Outro]
Yesterday is history
Tomorrow is a mystery
Today is a gift
Thats why we call it the present
Let me tell you about a girl I know
She's my baby and I love her so
Every morning when the sun comes up
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah I just love her so
When I call her on the telephone
She says: baby, I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
She'll be knocking on my door



In the evening when the sun goes down
And there ain't nobody else around
She kisses me and she holds me tight
She says: baby everything is alright
That's why I know, that's why I know
Hallelujah I just love her so
Hallelujah I just love her so
Hallelujah I just love that chick so
She's not a girl who misses much
Do-do do-do do-do
Oh, yeah
She's well-acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand like a lizard on a window pane
The man in the crowd with the multi-coloured mirror's on his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate and donated to the National Trust
I need a fix, 'cause I'm going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix, 'cause I'm going down
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun 



Mother Superior jump the gun
Happiness (happiness) is a warm gun (bang bang, shoot shoot)
Happiness (happiness) is a warm gun, mama (bang bang, shoot shoot)
When I hold you in my arms (oh, yeah)
And I feel (oo) my finger on your trigger (oh, yeah)
I know (oo) nobody can do me no harm (oh, yeah)
Because (happiness) is a warm gun, mama (bang bang, shoot shoot)
Happiness (happiness) is a warm gun, yes, it is (bang bang, shoot shoot)
Happiness is a warm - yes it is - gun (happiness)
(Bang bang, shoot shoot)
Well, don't you know that happiness (happiness)
Is a warm gun (is a warm gun), mama?
(Yeah)
she's not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do do do
She's well acquainted with the touch of the velvet
Hand
Like a lizard on a window pane.
The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the national trust.
I need a fix 'cause i'm going down



Town to the bits that i left uptown
I need a fix cause i'm going down
Mother superior jump the gun
Mother superior jump the gun
Mother superior jump the gun
Mother superior jump the gun.
Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
When i hold you in my arms
And i feel my finger on your trigger
I know no one can do me no harm
Because happiness is a warm gun
-yes it is.

Help, I need somebody
Help, not just anybody
Help, you know I need someone, help
When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self a**ured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round
Help me, get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before



Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round
Help me, get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me
When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self a**ured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round
Help me, get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me, help me, help me, oh

Over the water we must go.

3:42 - 3:45
- Obedience and Love.
- This is so.
3:45 - 3:47
- Ahme.
- This is so.
3:47 - 3:49
- The ring.
- Has nobody looked on the washbasin?
3:49 - 3:53
I am making the immediate
arrangements for my necessary...

- Are made.
- At once.
3:54 - 3:57

This is so.
4:22 - 4:25

- I don't like to.
4:25 - 4:27
- Go on, wave.
- Shall I?
4:27 - 4:30
They expect it, don't they.
4:30 - 4:33
Lovely lads and so natural.
4:33 - 4:35
Adoration hasn't gone to their heads.

5:31 - 5:36

- You trying to attract attention again?
5:36 - 5:39
She's pulling at it.
5:39 - 5:40
(Yells) Oh!
5:40 - 5:50
Ow!
5:50 - 5:51
She had my finger, you know...
5:51 - 5:55
Stop trying to drag things down
to your own level.
5:55 - 6:02
I thought she was a sandwich
until she went spare on my hand.
6:02 - 6:06
It's cold. it's a cold place.
6:06 - 6:11
- So, the ring?
- No. I could not get it off, Swami.

Hey! Have you been messing with me
in my kip?
7:55 - 7:57
I mean, with a fishing rod.
7:57 - 8:01
I wouldn't touch you with a plastic one.
What are you doing on the floor?
8:01 - 8:35
I'm tired.

How about this, Shufti?
9:08 - 9:11
Gold! All of it, pure gold.
9:11 - 9:14
In easy to handle
denominational nuggets. Unmarked.
9:14 - 9:17
- Not a mark on them.
- No, I hate them.
9:17 - 9:23
- No.
- It makes your fingers go green.
9:23 - 9:26
It's not the Beatle with the ring.
9:26 - 9:30

- No, unfortunately.
9:30 - 9:37

You shall have fun, eh?
9:43 - 9:49
No thanks, I'm rhythm guitar
and mouth organ.
9:49 - 9:51
I didn't encourage that wink.
9:51 - 9:54
- It is not the one.
- My gosh.
9:54 - 9:57
They all look the same in their similitude
and language.
9:57 - 10:00
Swami, its raining on your...
10:00 - 10:06
After them.
10:06 - 10:09
- Quickly, quickly.
- Yes, yes.
10:09 - 10:11
- Right, right.

10:11 - 10:15

- Now! Off!
- Off.

Oh, goodness me!
Sex is creeping in.
16:53 - 16:58
Young people see it in the bazaars,
market places, temple...
16:58 - 17:02
No wonder they turn up their noses
at a mystical impulse...
17:02 - 17:07
We're taking up fox hunting so young
people are involved in their sacrifices.
17:07 - 17:12
And will understand the deep
significance of blood well shed.
17:12 - 17:17
Of course I don't expect you to see
eye to eye with me...
17:17 - 17:22
What? Who? Where?
17:22 - 17:49
Now... lf you'll pardon me.
17:49 - 17:52
It's played out, any road?
You know, rings...
17:52 - 17:54
- Very nice.
- It's yours.
17:54 - 17:58
Nah! My missus wouldn't wear a ring
like that. Ostentatious, that is!
17:58 - 18:02
- He's from the west.
- Nah, east. Stepney.
18:02 - 18:06
- Does this ring mean anything to you?
- Freemason?
18:06 - 18:10
- You're all English!
- That's what unions are for.
18:10 - 18:15
I tell a lie. We have got one in there
from the mystic east... Or we did have.
18:15 - 18:17
(Hollers) Hey, Abdul!
18:17 - 18:20
- Yes.
- We did have one, didn't we?
18:20 - 18:23
That lad from the sunnier climate,
east of Suez?
18:23 - 18:26
Very nice he was, too.
18:26 - 18:39
I think he's still down there,
in the coal hole.
18:39 - 18:42
Doesn't the blood rush to your head, sir?
18:42 - 18:44
Doesn't the eastern flavour
come expensive?
18:44 - 18:47
Doesn't the blood rush to your stomach?
18:47 - 18:49
Is this ring nasty, sir?
18:49 - 18:55
Argh! Kaili! Oh dear, I must lie down.
18:55 - 18:59
Oh! That's better.
18:59 - 19:02
Excuse me...
This menu...
19:02 - 19:23

19:25 - 19:35
(Gasps) Oh...
19:35 - 19:41
Hey, did you...
19:41 - 19:46
There's a man down there on his head.
19:46 - 19:48
Arthur?
19:48 - 19:51
(Whooshes)
19:51 - 19:57
Could you pick this up for me, please?

It's rather a jolly place.
20:24 - 20:27
- Soup, please.
- Soup, yeah.
20:27 - 20:29
He has three hours to live.
20:29 - 20:33
- Say no more.
- I can say no more.
20:33 - 20:35
I ordered soup too.
20:35 - 20:48
- Soup!
- Soup.
20:48 - 20:53
Pardon me, sir. That's a very
fascinating ring you've got there.
20:53 - 20:55
- Unless I'm mistaken.
- Is it?
20:55 - 20:59
The dreaded sacred sacrificial
ring of the dread Kaili.
20:59 - 21:00
- Say no more.
- I can say no more.
21:00 - 21:04
Excuse me. if he is to be sacrificed
before Kaili,
21:04 - 21:06
why is he not painted red?
21:06 - 21:14
I've never had the courage to ask him,
but as he's my best friend I will.
21:14 - 21:17
- Whats this? Gla**es?
- That's right, sir. Gla**es.
21:17 - 21:21
A victim is offered
to the dread Kaili everyday.
21:21 - 21:23
All are happy to go.
21:23 - 21:26
He who wins is privileged to wear
the sacred ring
21:26 - 21:29
from sun to moon,
from moon to sun.
21:29 - 21:33
And at the end of the happy day
he is slaughtered jolly with a knife.
21:33 - 21:38
And sacrificed jolly with a knife,
so I'm told, with that ring.
21:38 - 21:39
Three hours to live.
21:39 - 21:43
- (Man) You have till five o'clock.
- Before a new victim is chosen.
21:43 - 21:46
You are lucky to be chosen!
21:46 - 21:51
My old mum would give her right hand
to be chosen.
21:51 - 21:54
- Whats this?
- A season ticket.
21:54 - 22:00
I like a lot of seasoning in my soup.
22:00 - 22:02
There's somebody been in this soup.
22:02 - 22:06
I got it from this Eastern bird... lady...
in a fan letter.
22:06 - 22:11
I get all sorts.
Rubbish, though, isn't it? Sacrifice.
22:11 - 22:13
No? Come off!
22:13 - 22:17
So, get in touch with your authorities
and send back the ring to this lady,
22:17 - 22:19
who will then go happy to Kaili.
22:19 - 22:22
- Thank you.
- (Bhuta) Three hours.
22:22 - 22:24
There's a footprint in here.
22:24 - 22:28
Here, you have a go.
22:28 - 22:35
(Gasps) Flee!
22:35 - 22:54
(Woman screams)
22:54 - 22:57
We have lots of little problems like this.
Some of them matrimonial.
22:57 - 22:59
(Laughs)
22:59 - 23:01
This ring is not stone.
23:01 - 23:12
- I've only got three hours to live.
- Therefore, it must be a metal.
23:12 - 23:17
- I don't know this metal.
- You're not getting anywhere, are you?
23:17 - 23:20
Early days yet, sir.
Therefore it must be an alloy.
23:20 - 23:26
There's a certain amount of hurry up
involved here. My life is in danger.
23:26 - 23:28
Three ten.
23:28 - 23:30
- The wheel.
- Not the wheel.
23:30 - 23:34
Even the Royal House of Hanover
had the wheel, sir.
23:34 - 23:46
(Whirring)
23:46 - 23:49
- I've never seen anything like it.
- You've failed.
23:49 - 23:53
- I suggest you see a specialist.
- What kind? Your tools are broken.
23:53 - 23:56
The fire brigade once got my head
out of some railings.
23:56 - 24:01
- Did you want them to?
- No. I left it there when not at school.
24:01 - 24:03
You can see a lot of the world
from railings.
24:03 - 24:09
(Electronic beeping)
24:09 - 24:12
I like operations,
they give you a sense of outlook.
24:12 - 24:14
This won't work.
24:14 - 24:17
It could work if the government
would spend more money.
24:17 - 24:20
Made in America you see.
24:20 - 24:22
Another failure.
24:22 - 24:25
The idea is...
The idea as I see it
24:25 - 24:29
is that we expand the molecules
and the ring grows bigger and drops off.
24:29 - 24:33
- Whats your electricity bill like?
- It's sort of a long counterfoil.
24:33 - 24:37
It's not dropping off.
24:37 - 24:41
Voltage!
Voltage... up, up...
24:41 - 24:43
Up, up!
24:43 - 24:46
- Are you sure I'm earthed?
- Oh no, hold on. Thank you.
24:46 - 24:50
Made in America.
Streets ahead of anything we've got.
24:50 - 24:52
This is English.
24:52 - 24:55
- Is it green, the earth in America?
- In some places its brown.
24:55 - 24:57
He's not earthed.
24:57 - 25:04
He's an idiot.
Has a degree in woodwork. I ask you!
25:04 - 25:07
Done.
25:07 - 25:10
- 5... 4...
- Come on.
25:10 - 25:15
3-2-1-go! I observe the procedure.
He'll thank me for it in the end.
25:15 - 25:18
Scientist, you're getting nowhere.
25:18 - 25:22
It's the plugs.
Good British plugs.
25:22 - 25:26
All this America rig. Wrong voltage.
That's what foxes me.
25:26 - 25:28
- How do you feel?
- I used to use my hands.
25:28 - 25:32
He used to use his hands.
25:32 - 25:35
- Will he still be able to drum?
- Did he do a lot of it?
25:35 - 25:41
- Voltage... up!
- I'm no mean hand at the old sticks.
25:41 - 25:42
The voltage, up, up, up!
25:42 - 25:48
- Hey, he's calling you. Up, up, up!
- Up, up, up!
25:48 - 25:52
The bunker!
25:52 - 25:59
(Electronic humming)
25:59 - 26:03
- I can't watch.
- It's working! Give it the gun, Algernon.
26:03 - 26:10
(Whirring)
26:10 - 26:12
Stop it!
26:12 - 26:14
It's more than my job's worth!
26:14 - 26:17
He's out to rule the world
if he can get a government grant.
26:17 - 26:31
Outrageous!
You're nothing but a mad scientist!
26:31 - 26:33
Fantastic!
26:33 - 26:37
With a ring like that I could,
dare I say it, rule the world.
26:37 - 26:40
I must have the ring...
Algernon, the laser.
26:40 - 26:44
Get your hands off him
or I'll call the Metropolitan scuffers!
26:44 - 26:46
The laser...
26:46 - 26:50
- Get him off.
- I must have this ring. The laser.
26:50 - 26:55
Halt! Release him or I'll shoot
and I am a dead eyeshot shooting.

27:01 - 27:04

- The laser, yes...
27:04 - 27:07
I'm better with animals
than plugs and transistors.
27:07 - 27:10
MIT was after me,
wanted me to rule the world for them.
27:10 - 27:13
Daddy being the local master
of the hounds.
27:13 - 27:16
That's where I get it from,
my love of animals.
27:16 - 27:20
They trust me.
I should have been in vivisection.
27:20 - 27:24
How do you know we can trust her?
She's had your fingers before, Ringo.
27:24 - 27:28
Well, that was a mistake.
I can vouch for her. We're very close.
27:28 - 27:32

- Get them!

- What filthy ways are these?
- You can put that away.

That one with the large ned.

Neb!
And its yours.
35:48 - 35:54
- Keep your hands up.

In the name of science
I demand that ring.
35:56 - 35:57
It's yours!
35:57 - 36:01

- A couple of bob, at least.
36:01 - 36:05
Had to do all this myself... Backward
Britain they call us on Wall Street.
36:05 - 36:09

No, I could not.

- Some people's are.
- Show us your hand, Ringo.
58:58 - 59:00
- You want to chuck one in?

- It won't affect it.
59:03 - 59:07
I don't know many...

I'm chucking one in.

- Like an old boot.

One card. Dealer takes one.

See, that didn't hurt.
59:22 - 59:26
- Will you hold this drumstick?
- Manchester has a good drummer.
59:26 - 59:29
Well, I don't just drum with it, do I?
59:29 - 59:31
- What else then?
- I use it, you know.
59:31 - 59:35
Quite a good-looking fellow, too.
I'll raise you.
59:35 - 59:39
You haven't used that finger
in the past hour and we're in danger.

use of that finger, have we?
59:42 - 59:44
- No.
- And again.

We're risking our lives to preserve
a useless member.

- And again.
- You're joking!
59:59 - 60:11
Just hold this drumstick.
60:11 - 60:14
You've raised it a little bundle
on the quiet.
60:14 - 60:17
- It's like having a tooth out.
- I've got a good hand.

I will see... I've won it.
60:25 - 60:29
- Cut.
- No!

65:11 - 65:15
Look John, I've had some great times
with this finger.
65:15 - 65:17
How do you know I wouldn't miss it?

- Easterner speaks with forked tongue.
- What does he say?
76:34 - 76:37
Pa**ing this way with hot foot
to the temple.
76:37 - 76:40
Don't encourage him!
You've got the part, Paul.
76:40 - 76:44
- Dare we ask how you know?
- How! I saw those footprints...
76:44 - 76:47
And this guidebook.
76:47 - 77:03
- To the temple.
- (Whistles)
77:03 - 77:21
After them... slowly!
77:21 - 77:25
- That's not it, is it?
- It's on the map as being here.
77:25 - 77:30
That temple under the rock,
that swimming pool that we came up in...
77:30 - 77:34
- I'm lost!
- This isn't a temple, is it?
77:34 - 77:38
- So this is a famous temple?
- Should be. It's gone.
77:38 - 77:41
I hope that disembowelling thingy
has gone, too.
77:41 - 77:44
- Was there ever a temple here?
- Never, sir.
77:44 - 77:49
Old army place. Well-known
place of retreat for courting couples
77:49 - 77:51
who like the echoes of bugles
as they court.
77:51 - 77:54
That's my theory.
77:54 - 77:56
Ugh!
77:56 - 77:58
- Aren't we going in?
- No, lets not.
77:58 - 78:01
Oh, come on lads,
where's that famous pluck?
78:01 - 78:04
- I haven't got any. Have you, George?
- Did have.
78:04 - 78:08
- I have had.
- I will have.
78:08 - 78:10
He's a bit soft that inspector,
isn't he?
78:10 - 78:12
He never takes his hat off.
78:12 - 78:30
It's very hot over here
for wearing a hat.
78:30 - 78:35
- I'm off.
- Typical!
78:35 - 78:37
(Yells) Kaili!
78:37 - 78:39
Argh!
78:39 - 78:44
- Kaili!
- Kaili!
78:44 - 78:46
(Electric buzz)
78:46 - 78:50
The fiends! They've electrified
the wire with high tension. HT.
78:50 - 79:06
The fiends!
79:06 - 79:08
(Hollers) Help me!
79:08 - 79:10
Help!
79:10 - 79:12
He's mine!
79:12 - 79:15
Help!
79:15 - 79:42
Help me!
79:42 - 79:48
There's one on the back,
but its not the right one.
79:48 - 79:54
Come here, boy! Let me explain.
79:54 - 80:00
This is no time for foolish tricks!
This is a hired car.
80:00 - 80:03
Back up and smash him off.
80:03 - 80:07
(Algernon) Now, this will get him!
80:07 - 80:11
Oh! Never mind. Try again.
80:11 - 80:17
This should give him a headache.
80:17 - 80:20
Where's he gone?
80:20 - 80:23
- That's done it, he's gone.
- I can't start the car.
80:23 - 80:26
- (Engine splutters)
- Hello.
80:26 - 80:31
Oh, hello! Hang on a minute...
80:31 - 80:36
On, on!
80:36 - 80:38
I seem to be having
a slight difficulty.
80:38 - 80:51
To the right! oh...
80:51 - 80:56
- I think it might be the wrong key.
- On!
80:56 - 80:59
On!
80:59 - 81:04
(Engine starts)
81:04 - 81:20
(Algernon) Got it.
Didn't take long, did it?
81:20 - 81:28
Thanks for the lift, sailor!
81:28 - 81:31
- Where did the thugs go?
- They've vanished.
81:31 - 81:33
- He's got a plan.
- Avery famous plan.
81:33 - 81:35
Superintendent, you've got a plan.
81:35 - 81:37
- Yes...
- Superintendent.
81:37 - 83:21
I've got a plan.
83:21 - 83:23
(Hollers) Ringo!
83:23 - 83:25
Ringo!
83:25 - 83:28
- Ringo!
- Ringo!
83:28 - 83:30
- Ringo!
- Ringo!
83:30 - 83:32
Ringo!
83:32 - 83:34
(Dogs bark)
83:34 - 83:46
Ringo!
83:46 - 83:47
All right, talk!
83:47 - 83:55
We know he's a prisoner,
but where?
83:55 - 83:57
- I'm a perfect surgeon.
- Huh?
83:57 - 84:00
- I'm a perfect surgeon.
- He was asked to take it up.
84:00 - 84:03
Alas... Scalpel.
84:03 - 84:12
Sca...
84:12 - 84:15
Sand in the generator.
84:15 - 84:18
It gets everywhere. No wonder
I never get anything done.
84:18 - 84:21
Fix it, Algernon.
84:21 - 84:24
You wouldn't want me to go in
with a blunt scalpel.
84:24 - 84:26
Fix it!
84:26 - 84:30
I'm a decent employer,
but he takes advantage of me.
84:30 - 84:37
- It's the heat, it makes him stroppy.
- Luckily.
84:37 - 84:40
I've got some juice.
84:40 - 84:44
(Ringo) I can't understand it. They kept
pulling my nose. Mine of all noses!
84:44 - 84:48
- Whats that?
- Distilled from the essence of orchids.
84:48 - 84:52
Hands up!
84:52 - 84:54
- Whats that?
- Distilled from the essence...
84:54 - 84:59
Not distilled from the essence of orchids
found only in certain recesses?
84:59 - 85:05
At last! I'll have my just reward.
Give it to me! Sir Tberius Foot Juice!
85:05 - 85:08
- But the ring...
- Who needs it now that I have this.
85:08 - 85:11
- Do you know what this is?
- A Webley automatic...
85:11 - 85:15
It's Nobel Prize juice. Set sail for home,
for England! A j**el set in the sea!
85:15 - 85:18
The government in the palm of my hand.
Whats it say?
85:18 - 85:20
- You're going on a sea voyage...
- No, this!
85:20 - 85:24
- (Algernon) I don't know.
- Haven't you a degree in Eastern?
85:24 - 85:27
- (Algernon) I don't think so.
- Lets get it translated.
85:27 - 85:33
- Now!
- Right!
85:33 - 85:43
- I can't swim.
- What do you mean you can't swim?
85:43 - 85:46
(Clang) Treacherous Woman,
tremble...
85:46 - 85:49
In the name of Preverti,
daughter of the mountains,
85:49 - 85:52
whose embrace with Rani
made the whole world tremble.
85:52 - 85:55
- Wait till my mates get you.
- I don't think so...
85:55 - 86:00
We've had two battalions flown in
specially to ambush your friends.
86:00 - 86:02
They're quite merciless.
86:02 - 86:08
One word of warning from you
and you die instantly.
86:08 - 86:11
Oh, mother Kaili,
86:11 - 86:13
whose name is the Terrible...
86:13 - 86:15
I'm going to miss the sacrifice.
86:15 - 86:18
(Clang) ...whose name
is the inaccessible,
86:18 - 86:24
whose name is the Black Mother,
mother of darkness!
86:24 - 86:25
We turn our hearts to...
86:25 - 86:27
(Ringo) No!
86:27 - 86:29
(Clang) ...drinker of blood...
86:29 - 86:32
- It's off! I'm saved!
- ...k**er of demons,
86:32 - 86:36
drink of this vessel,
gorge on this blood, our offering...
86:36 - 86:40
Get sacrificed!
I don't subscribe to your religion!
86:40 - 86:44
- There he is!
- It just came off!
86:44 - 86:46
(Yells) Quickly! After them!
86:46 - 86:48
I'm going to miss the sacrifice.
86:48 - 86:52
- It came off! I just showed courage.
- How many fingers you got left?
86:52 - 86:55
- You're all red again.
- I'm beginning to like it.
86:55 - 86:59

To lead a better life
I need my love to be here
Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere



Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care

Hey jude, don't make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.
Hey jude, don't be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.
And anytime you feel the pain, hey jude, refrain,
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.
Hey jude, don't let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.



Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.
So let it out and let it in, hey jude, begin,
Youre waiting for someone to perform with.
And don't you know that it's just you, hey jude, you'll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.
Hey jude, don't make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh.
Na na na na na ,na na na, hey jude...
Hey jude, don't make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.
Hey jude, don't be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.
And anytime you feel the pain, hey jude, refrain,
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.
Hey jude, don't let me down.

She was a working girl
North of England way
(Now, she's hit the big time)
In the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me
This is what I'd say
Honey pie
You are making me crazy
I'm in love, but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home?
Oh, honey pie
My position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
Of your Hollywood song
You became a legend
Of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee
Oh, honey pie
You are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong 



Honey pie, come back to me
Oo
Yeah
I like it like that (oo, ah)
I like this kind of, hot kind of music
Hot kind of music
Play it to me, play it to me
Hollywood blues
Will the wind that blew her boat across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me? t-t-tee
Now, honey pie
You are making me crazy
I'm in love, but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home?

I don't want to spoil the party, so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here
So I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone
Please let me know
I've had a drink or two and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong
I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her
Though tonight she's made me sad
I still love her
If I find her, I'll be glad
I still love her

I'm a loser
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
Of all the love I have won or have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end
I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky



Is it for her or myself that I cry?
I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
What have I done to deserve such a fate?
I realize I have left it too late
And so it's true, pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all

I'm looking through you
Where did you go?
I thought I knew you
What did I know?
You don't look different
But you have changed

Your lips are moving

Your voice is soothing
But the words aren't clear
You don't sound different
I've learned the game

Did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit
Of disappearing overnight
You're thinking of me
The same old way
You were above me
But not today
The only difference

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float upstream (float upstream)
Please don't wake me
No, don't shake me
Leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping
Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need (there's no need)
Please don't spoil my day
I'm miles away
And after all
I'm only sleeping
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window 



Taking my time
Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling
Please don't spoil my day
I'm miles away
And after all

You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind.

When you know what money can bring
You better leave me alone,
I don't need a thing from you
You better take yourself home
Go and count a ring or two
If you've got trouble,
Then you got less trouble than me



You say you're worried,
You can't be as worried as me
You're quite contend to be bad
With all the vantage you had over me
Just cause your trouble
And don't bring your troubles to me
Ah rock on anybody
You better leave me alone,
I don't need a thing from you
You better take yourself home
Go and count a ring or two
If you've got trouble,
Then you got less trouble than me
You say you're worried,
You can't be as worried as me
You're quite contend to be bad
With all the vantage you had over me
Just cause your trouble
And don't bring your troubles to me
Just cause your trouble
And don't bring your troubles to me

There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning



When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more
In my life-- I love you more
There are places i'll remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends i still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life i've loved them all
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning



When i think of love as something new
Though i know i'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know i'll often stop and think about them
In my life i love you more
Though i know i'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know i'll often stop and think about them
In my life i love you more
In my life i love you more

Lyrics:

Lyrics:
It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh how I've been alone
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried



But if your heart breaks
Don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong
Hold on, I won't delay
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried
I feel as though
You ought to know
That I've been good
As good as I can be
And if you do
I'll trust in you
And know that you
Will wait for me
It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh how I've been alone
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried
I feel as though
You ought to know
That I've been good
As good as I can be
And if you do
I'll trust in you
And know that you
Will wait for me
It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh how I've been alone
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried
It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh, how I've been alone
In spite of all the danger
In spite of all that may be
I'll do anything for you
Anything you want me to
If you'll be true to me
In spite of all the heartache
That you may cause me
I'll do anything for you
Anything you want me to
If you'll be true to me
I'll look after you
Like I've never done before
I'll keep all the others
From knocking at your door



In spite of all the danger
In spite of all that may be
I'll do anything for you
Anything you want me to
If you'll be true to me
Yeah!
In spite of all the heartache
That you may cause me
I'll do anything for you
Anything you want me to
If you'll be true to me
I'll do anything for you
Anything you want me to
If you'll be true to me
Oh yeah, alright
Are you gonna be in my dreams, tonight?
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you



Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
And in the end the love you take
Is equal to the love you make

Spoken:
To your mother!
It's all too much
It's all too much
When I look into your eyes
Your love is there for me
And the more I go inside
The more there is to see
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere it's what you make for us to take
It's all too much
Floating down the stream of time
From life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are
Or where you'd like to be
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake
So take a piece but not too much
Sell me on a silver sun
Where I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere
And get me home for tea
It's all too much for me to take
There's plenty there for everybody
The more you give, the more you get
The more it is and it's too much
Nice to have the time to take
This opportunity
Time for me to look at you
And you to look at me
It's all too much for me to see 



The love that's shining all around here
The more I learn, the less I know
And what I do is all too much
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere it's what you make for us to take
It's all too much
It's too much
It's too much
With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
You're too much
We are getting better
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too
It's all too much, it's all too much
When i look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more i go inside, the more there is to see
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much
Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world's a birthday cake,



So take a piece but not too much
Set me on a silver sun, for i know that i'm free
Show me that i'm everywhere, and get me home for tea
It's all to much for me to see
A love that's shining all around here
The more i am, the less i know
And what i do is all too much
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much
It's too much.....it's too much
Too much too much too much (fade to end)

There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say, but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy!
Nothing you can make that can't be made
No one you can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you in time



It'easy!
Nothing you can know that isn't known
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
Nowhere you can be that isn't where you were meant to be
It'easy!
All you need is Love
Love is all you need.
I'd say some day
I'm bound to give my heart away
When I do
It's for you love, true love
Seems to be all I'm thinking of
But it's true
It's for you
They said that love was a lie
Told me that I
Never should try to find
Somebody who'd be kind



Kind to only me
So I just tell them they're right
Who wants a fight
Tell them I quite agree
Nobody'd love me
Then I look at you
And love comes love shows
I give my heart and no one knows
That I do
It's for you
It's for you
It's for you
[Verse 1]
I get high when I see you go by
My oh my
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies
bu*terflies
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?
[Chorus]
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you



[Verse 2]
Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright
Very bright
Haven't I the right to make it up girl?
[Chorus]
[Outro]
Yes it's so hard loving you, loving you
I get high when i see you go by
My oh my.
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies,
bu*terflies
Why am i so shy when i'm beside you?
It's only love and that is all,
Why should i feel the way i do?
It's only love, and that is all,
But it's so hard loving you.
Is it right that you and i should fight



Ev'ry night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright,
Very bright.
Haven't i the right to make it up girl?
It's only love and that is all,
Why should i feel the way i do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you
Yes it's so hard loving you -- loving you.

[Instrumental]
(Instrumental)
I was dreaming of the past
And my heart was beating fast
I began to lose control
I began to lose control
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry that, I made you cry
I didn't want to hurt you
I'm just a jealous guy
I was feeling insecure
You might not love me anymore
I was shivering inside
I was shivering inside
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry that, I made you cry
I didn't want to hurt you



I'm just a jealous guy
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry that, I made you cry
I didn't want to hurt you
I'm just a jealous guy
I was trying to catch your eye
Thought that you was trying to hide
I was swallowing my pain
I was swallowing my pain
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry that, I made you cry
I didn't want to hurt you
I'm just a jealous guy
Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go, laughing all the way
Bells on bob-tail ring, making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight
[Chorus:]
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright, was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot



He got into a drifted bank and we got upsot
[Chorus:]
A day or two ago, the story I must tell
I went out on the snow, and on my back I fell
A gent was riding by, in a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed as there I sprawling lie but quickly drove away
[Chorus:]
Now the ground is white, go it while you're young
Take the girls tonight, and sing this sleighing song
Just get a bob-tailed bay, two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack! you'll take the lead
[Chorus:]
[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Help
You're making my ears bleed, you need a muzzle
Why are you pissed off all the time? Didn't your mom give you a cuddle?
You're the type of guy who could die of heart attack just in the shower
You need to chill out for a minute, and smoke weed for an hour
Every time I watch your show, all you do is scream at me
And your face looks like a sh** I took, high on LSD
I'm John Lennon, I'm a legend, I can see through all your tricks
I wonder how much George Bush paid you to s** his dick
[Verse 2: Bill O'Reilly]
You f**ing long hair, living in your Yellow Submarine
Well you're about to get sunk by the right wing political machine
Stop your presses Lennon, you call me mister Bill O'Reilly
When it comes to squashing limeys: I come recommended highly



You're weak. Between you and me there's no comparison
I'll beat you so bad you weep gently like George Harrison
You're Paul McCartney's b**h, with less talent than Ringo
And I'd rather s** George Bush's dick than Yoko Ono's
[Verse 3: John Lennon]
You can't buy me love, but I'll kick your a** for free
I'll take Maxwell's silver hammer and give you a lobotomy
I'm tired of how you scheme, to stir the people up
Why don't you just take a vacation and shut the f** up!
[Verse 4: Bill O'Reilly]
Cause I'm evil, heart blacker than Don Cheadle
Ten thousand dollar shoes I used to stomp out a beetle
Don't tell me to shut the f** up, that's how I survive
Now here's sting--
What?
f** it, we'll do it live!
Deep down in Louisianna
Close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods
Among the evergreens
There stand a country cabin
Made of clay and wood
Where lives a young country boy
Named Johnny B. Goode
He never ever learned
To read or write a book so well
But he could play his guitar
Just like a-ringing a bell
Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B. Goode!
He used to carry his guitar
In a gunny sack
Sit beneath the trees
By the railroad track
Oh sitting and a-playing
In the shade
Drumming to the rhythm
That the drivers made



People pa**ing by
Used to stop and say
My oh my
That country boy can play
Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B. Goode!
Well his mama told him
Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader
Of a big old band
Many people coming
From miles around
To hear you play your music
Till the sun goes down
Maybe some day
Your name will be in light
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight!
Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B.Goode!

We've been friends for oh so long
I let you share what's mine
When you mess with the girl I love
It's time to draw the line
Keep your hands (Keep your hands) off my baby
Ain't I gonna tell you but one more time
Who, keep your hands (Keep your hands) off my baby
Boy, you get it through your head
That girl is mine
I don't mind if you lend my clothes
But you will be in touch
There is somethin' that you get straight
There's one thing you don't touch
Keep your hands (Keep your hands) off my baby
Ain't I gonna tell you but a one more time



Who, keep your hands (Keep your hands) off my baby
Can you get it through your head?
That girl is mine
Ow baby!
Keep your hands (Keep your hands) off my baby
Ain't I gonna tell you but a one more time
Who, keep your hands (Keep your hands) off my baby
Can you get it through your head?
That girl is mine
(Keep your hands) Who, keep your hands off my baby
She's mine (Keep your hands off my baby)
You better watch yourself now
Boy, you get it through your head
That girl is mine
We've been friends for oh so long,
I won't let you share what's mine.
When you mess with the girl i love,
It's time to draw the line.
Keep your hands off my baby.
Ain't a-gonna tell you
One more time.
So keep your hands off my baby,
For it's gonna do you in:
That girl is mine.
I don't mind if you lend my clothes,
[...] much

Lady madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.
Who finds the money? when you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?
Friday night arrives without a suitcase.
Sunday morning creep in like a nun.
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace.
See how they run.
Lady madonna, baby at your breast.
Wonder how you manage to feed the rest.



See how they run.
Lady madonna, lying on the bed,
Listen to the music playing in your head.
Tuesday afternoon is never ending.
Wednesday morning papers didn't come.
Thursday night your stockings needed mending.
See how they run.
Lady madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.

[Speech]
[Lee Peters:] But now, John has his work cut out on the next one, as he takes his guitar on and off his neck and pulls the harmonica in and out of his face.
[John:] Harp. It's a harp.
[Lee:] What? Harp?
[John:] The harp. 'Cause I'm playing the harp on this one.
[Lee:] Playing the harp?
[John:] Harmonica I play on "Love Me Do," harp, on this one, little goes in the orange.



[Lee:] But it goes in and out? Do you wanna do this announcement? Well, go on, you go ahead, no, it's all right. Tell them. Tell them about the next song.
[John:] Oh, er, we'd like to carry on with Chuck Berry's "I Gotta Find My Baby." Don't know where she's been, pardon, hello? Love these goon shows.
Each day just goes so fast
I turn around, it's past
You don't get time to hang a sign on me
Love me while you can
Before I'm a dead old man
A life time is so short
A new one can't be bought
But what you've got means such a lot to me
Make love all day long 



Make love singing songs
Make love all day long
Make love singing songs
There's people standing round
Who'll screw you in the ground
They'll fill you in with all their sins, you'll see
I'll make love to you
If you want me to
Each day just goes so fast
I turn around - it's past
You don't time to hang a sign on me
Love me while you can
Before i'm dead old man
A lifetime is so short
A new one can't be bought
And what you've got means such a lot to me



Make love all day long
Make love singing songs
There's people standing round
Who screw you in the ground
They'll fill your head with all the things you see
I'll make love to you
If you want me too

To lead a better life
I need my love to be here
Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere



Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there
Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh
Lovely Rita, meter maid
Lovely Rita, meter maid
Lovely Rita, meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away
Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in the ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man
Lovely Rita, meter maid
May I inquire discreetly 



When are you free to take some tea with me?
Rita
Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home and nearly made it
Sitting on a sofa with a sister or two
Oh lovely Rita, meter maid
Where would I be without you?
Give us a wink and make me think of you
Lovely Rita, meter maid
They'll never believe it
Lovely rita meter maid.
Lovely rita meter maid.

Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high 



Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking-gla** ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

00:05:06 I can't go any quicker!
00:05:09 Stop it!
00:05:11 Come on!
00:05:12 Richard B. Starkey and his Aunt Jessica are always arguing about one thing or another.
00:05:18 Oh, I'm going!
00:05:21 Oh, go! Go on!
00:05:22 And what with today being Sunday and the weather looking up, you'd think they'd have given it a rest.
00:05:27 For goodness' sake, stop sitting down!
00:05:30 All right, all right, what's your hurry?
00:05:32 But no -- on and on they go.
00:05:36 "Good morning," said Richard.
00:05:38 "Good afternoon, sir," said the courier.
00:05:41 They were late.
00:05:41 JESSICA: 'Allo, Flo, you all right, girl?
00:05:42 I'll sit 'ere.
00:05:45 RICHARD: Yes, I'll have the window seat.
00:05:46 JESSICA: All right, so you'll have the window seat!
00:05:52 Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.
00:05:55 Welcome to Magical Mystery Tours!
00:06:00 I am your courier, Jolly Jimmy Johnson!
00:06:03 All my friends call me Jolly Jimmy -- and you are all my friends!
00:06:07 Over here is your hostess -- that lovely, delightful, delectable... Wendy Winters!
00:06:12 Lovely girl, lovely!
00:06:13 And over here, our driver for the trip, that wonderful driver, we hope...
00:06:18 Ha ha ha!
00:06:19 Alf! Off you go, Alf!
00:06:21 Here we go now. Splendid!
00:06:22 Fasten your safety belts, please.
00:06:25 Away-way-way we go!
00:06:28 Away we go, Alf, splendid!
00:06:31 Very comfy in the back there, is it? Lovely.
00:06:33 I say it's lovely. Get your popcorn out!
00:06:37 Ha ha!
00:06:38 Right hand down. There we are, splendid.
00:06:41 And away we go.
00:06:42 Anyway, I'll tell you something, you ain't coming away with me anymore.
00:06:46 Who bought the tickets for this trip? I did!
00:06:48 Yeah, with my money. I gave you the money.
00:06:50 I'm taking you out. You're not taking me anywhere.
00:06:52 I gave you the money, darling. Remember that.
00:06:55 And you've done nothing but eye all the fellas on the coach since we got here.
00:06:59 Shut your cakehole!
00:06:59 I dunno, since Uncle Jack died, you've never been the same.
00:07:03 Of course, 'cause I ain't got Uncle Jack, have I?
00:07:06 I remember him. I remember him.
00:07:07 If I ain't got him, I've got to get somebody else.
00:07:10 You should know, you're old enough at 21!
00:07:13 You should do a bit of knitting, do you good.
00:07:15 Who for? You?
00:07:17 Should I knit for you?
00:07:19 No, don't knit for me.
00:07:23 [Car horn blares] Who is that man?
00:07:31 Oh, that's Mr Bloodvessel.
00:07:33 He's quite harmless. He comes on all the trips.
00:07:36 He thinks he's a courier.
00:07:38 Last trip, he thought he was the driver.
00:07:42 PAUL: Well, you know, when I saw your first film, I really thought you had something, but it was -- WOMAN: I was only about 6, then.
00:07:50 PAUL: Wasn't it "Blue Lady"? "Lady in Blue"?
00:07:53 Something like that.
00:07:55 WOMAN: How old are you?
00:07:56 PAUL: I myself am 30...
00:07:57 but I look a little younger due to the Fair Isle sweater.
00:08:01 Excuse me, sir.
00:08:02 I'd like to take a photograph of the young lady, do you mind?
00:08:05 I don't mind if Miss Gabriella doesn't.
00:08:08 Well, Miss Gabriella doesn't mind.
00:08:10 Thank you, bye-bye.
00:08:12 See you later, maybe.
00:08:13 Or we won't see him later. Can I have you out there?

00:30:37 in a land that no-one knows...
00:30:39 live four or five magicians who spend their days casting wonderful spells.
00:30:44 Come with me now into that secret place where the eyes of man have never set foot.

00:31:39 The bus?
00:31:45 The bus is ten miles north on the Dewsbury road.
00:31:49 Oh!
00:31:50 It's only ten miles away.
00:31:53 Bus... ten miles!
00:31:55 Soon be here.
00:31:57 [ECHOING] The bus, 10 miles away...
00:32:02 Oh, ladies and gentlemen, quickly, look to your left!
00:32:04 Now there you see the ancient Roman ruins.
00:32:08 Now they really have been there an awful long time.
00:32:11 They are, in fact, a little difficult to see because they're almost flattened to the ground...
00:32:16 Meanwhile, back on the bus, things are happening -- and life lobbles on.
00:32:22 Indeed, the magic is so powerful that even Mr Bloodvessel emerges from his shell.
00:32:28 He turns to speak.
00:32:29 If I may take the liberty, Mister...
00:32:32 Be my guest.

I said I'm sitting here watching
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I said I'm sitting here wondering
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I ain't got no matches, but I sure got a long way to go
I'm an old poor boy
I'm a long way from home

And I'm a long way from home
I've never been happy
'Cause everything I ever did was wrong
Well, if you don't want my peaches, honey



Please don't shake my tree
If you don't want any of those peaches, honey
Please don't mess around my tree
I've got news for you, baby
Leave me here in misery, all right
Well, let me be your little dog
Till your big dog comes
Let me be your little dog
Till your big dog comes
And when your big dog gets here
Watch how your puppy dog runs
I said i'm sittin' here watchin'
Matchbox hole in my clothes.
I said i'm sittin' here watchin'
Matchbox hole in my clothes.
I ain't got no matches but i sure
Got a long way to go.
I'm an ol' poor boy, and i'm a
Long way from home.
I'm an ol' poor boy, and i'm a
Long way from home.
I'll never be happy cause everything i've
Ever did was wrong.
Well, if you don't want my peaches honey,
Please don't shake my tree.
Well, if you don't want my peaches honey,



Please don't shake my tree.
I got news for you baby, leave me here in
Misery.
Well, let me be your little dog, till your
Big dog comes.
Well, let me be your little dog, till your
Big dog comes.
And when your big dog gets here, watch how
Your puppy dog runs.
I said i'm sittin' here watchin'
Matchbox hole in my clothes.
I said i'm sittin' here watchin'

I ain't got no matches but i sure
Got a long way to go.

Joan was quizzical, studied metaphysical science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test-tube ohh-oh-oh-oh...
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine calls her on the phone
'Can I take you out to the pictures Joa-oa-oa-oan?'
But as she's getting ready to go a knock comes on the door...
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead
Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again, teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene
She tells Max to stay when the cla** has gone away, so he waits behind
Writing 50 times 'I must not be so-o-o-oo...'



But when she turns her back on the boy he creeps up from behind
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead
P.C. Thirty-One said 'we caught a dirty one', Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures ohh-oh-oh-oh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery say he must go free
(Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them so-o-o-oo
But as the words are leaving his lips a noise comes from behind
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon his head
Bang, Bang, Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that he was dead
Silver hammer

Made sure that she was dead
Back in school again maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene
She tells max to stay when the cla** has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times "i must not be so-o-o-oo..."



But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind
Bang, bang, maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead
B.c. thirty-one said "we caught a dirty one"
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures ohh-oh-oh-oh
Rose and valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them so-o-o-oo
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind
Bang, bang, maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Bang, bang, maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead

Joan was quizzical; studied pataphysical
Science in the home.
Late nights all alone with a test tube.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine,
Calls her on the phone.
"Can I take you out to the pictures,
Joa, oa, oa, oan?"
But as she's getting ready to go,
A knock comes on the door.
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head.
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead.
Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again.
Teacher gets annoyed.
Wishing to avoid and unpleasant
Sce, e, e, ene,
She tells Max to stay when the cla** has gone away,
So he waits behind
Writing fifty times "I must not be
So, o, o, o"
But when she turns her back on the boy,



He creeps up from behind.
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head.
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead.
P. C. Thirty-one said, "We caught a dirty one."

Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man

Takes him out to look at the queen

Always shouts out something obscene

Waiting to take you away, take you today

And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too

Will make me feel alright
Whoa

Is going away
She's got a ticker to ride
She's got a ticker to ride

'cause i looked up to your face.
I tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
That's a lie,
'cause i know where you've been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, i nearly died,
'cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.



If i were you'd realize that i
Love you more than any other guy,
And i'll forgive the lies that i
Heard before when you gave me no reply.
I've tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,

With another man in my place.
No reply, no reply.

Nobody I know could love me more than you,
You can give me so much love it seems untrue,
Listen to the bird who sings it to th tree,
And then when you've heard him see if you agree,
Nobody I know could love you more than me.
Everywhere I go the sun comes shining through,
Everyone I know is sure it shines for you,
Even in my dreams
I look into your eyes,
Suddenly it seems
I've found a paradise,
Everywhere I go the sun comes shining through,
It means so much to be a part of a heart of a wonderful one,



When other lovers are gone we'll live on,
We'll live on.
Even in my dreams
I look into your eyes,
Suddenly it seems
I've found a paradise,
Everywhere I go the sun comes shining through,
Nobody I know could love me more than you,
You can give me so much love it seems untrue,
Listen to the bird who sings it to the tree,
And then when you've heard him see if you agree,
Nobody I know could love you more than me.
Nobody I know could love you more than me.
As I was slowly pa**ing
An orphan's home one day,
I stopped for just a little while
To watch the children play.
Alone a boy was standing
And when I asked him why,
He turned with eyes that could not see
And he began to cry.
I'm nobody's child,
I'm nobody's child.
Just like the flowers
I'm growing wild.
I got no mummy's kisses



I got no daddy's smile.
Nobody wants me,
I'm nobody's child.
No mummy's arms to hold me
Or sue me when I cry,
'Cause sometimes I feel so lonesome
I wish that I could die.
I'll walk the streets of heaven
Where all blinds can see.
And just like for the other kids
It will be a home for me.

I once had a girl
Or should I say she once had me
She showed me her room
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?
She asked me to stay
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasn't a chair
I sat on a rug biding my time



Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said
"It's time for bed"
She told me she worked
In the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't
And crawled off to sleep in the bath
I once had a girl, or should i say, she once had me.
She showed me her room, isn't it good, norwegian wood?

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.
I told her i didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath.
And when i awoke i was alone, this bird had flown.
So i lit a fire, isn't it good, norwegian wood.

I found it out
What love is all about
And every day
It sure lets out
I see my baby
I get weak in my knees
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
My pappie told me
There'd be times like these
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
We meet the gang
And go to rocking Joes
The cats are something
On the heels and toes
I grab my baby
Tried to give her a squeeze
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
Well why must she be
Such a doggone tease?
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
She's got a way
That makes me act like a fool
Spent my money
Then she plays me cool
I begged her for kisses
On my bended knees
Oh won't you give me
Some loving, baby
Please please please
Though I keep trying hard
To make her mine
One day the wind will blow
And the sun will shine
Till that time



She puts my heart at ease
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart
And threw away the keys
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees, yeah

I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade
He'd let us in, knows where we've been
In his octopus' garden in the shade
I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus' garden with me
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade
We would be warm below the storm
In our little hide-away beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus' garden near a cave
We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found



I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade
We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe
(Happy and they're safe)
We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden with you
In an octopus' garden with you
In an octopus' garden with you

I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade
He'd let us in, knows where we've been
In his octopus' garden in the shade
I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus' garden with me
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade.

I want a love that's right
Right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short-haired girl
Who sometimes wears it twice as long
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now
I'm telling you
You know, you pick me up
From where some try to drag me down
When I see your smile
Replacing every thoughtless frown
Got me escaping from this zoo
Baby, I'm in love with you
So glad you came here
Won't be the same now
When I'm with you
If I grow up I'll be a singer
Wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you'll say
I'll live and love but maybe some day
Who knows, baby?
You may comfort me
Hey!
I may appear to be imperfect
My love is something you can't reject 



I'm changing faster than the weather
If you and me should get together
Who knows, baby?
You may comfort me
(Hey) I know my love is yours to miss
That love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start
I'm making sure that I'm not late (hey)
For your sweet top lip I'm in the queue
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you
And I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Doo-da)
(Doo-da-doo)
(Doo-da)
(Doo-da-doo)
(Doo-da)
(Doo-da-doo)

That love of your, to miss that love is something i'd hate.
I'll make an early start, i'm making sure that i'm not late.
For you sweet top lip i'm in the queue, baby, i'm in love with you.
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now when i'm with you.
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now when i'm with you.

once there was a way to get back home
once there was a way to get back home again



hey, you got to carry that way
My baby says she's travelling
On the one after 909
I said
Move over honey
I'm travelling on that line
I said
Move over once
Move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's travelling on the one after 909
I begged her not to go
And I begged her on my bended knee (yes, I did)
You're only fooling 'round
Only fooling 'round with me
I said
Move over once
Move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's travelling on the one after 909
Pick up my bags, run to the station
Railman said
You've got the wrong location
Pick up the bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong
Well, she said she's travelling on the one after 909
I said
Move over honey 



I'm travelling on that line
I said
Move over once

Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice

Oh, Danny Boy
The altar men are calling
My baby says she's trav'ling on the one after 909
I said move over honey i'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice.
I said i'm trav'ling on the one after 909 i begged her not to go and i begged her on my bended knees,
You're only fooling around, you're fooling around with me.

One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?
[Chorus]
I'm hoping everyday
I'm gonna hear you say
"You really make my wish come true"
Can you feel when I'm holding you near
All the things that I do?
So, my love, am I making it clear?
One and one is two
One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?
[Chorus]
Can't you see I've loved you from the start?



Don't you love me too?
I love you, but you're breaking my heart
From wanting you
One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?
[Chorus]
If you say that you're gonna be mine
Everything is alright
All the world would look so fine
If you'll be mine tonight
One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?
[Chorus]
If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
He just wrote it like that
When you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are
They just play it like that
It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is 



As it's only a northern song
It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When/As it's only a northern song
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct
There's nobody there
And I told you there's no-one there
If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not;
He just wrote it like that.
It doesn't really matter what chords i play
What words i say or time of day it is
As it's only a northern song
It doesn't really matter what clothes i wear
Or how i fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a northern song.
When you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are, they just play it like that



It doesn't really matter what chords i play
What words i say or time of day it is
As it's only a northern song.
It doesn't really matter what clothes i wear
Or how i fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a northern song.
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct, there's nobody there.
It doesn't really matter what chords i play
What words i say or time of day it is
And i told you there's no one there.

(All): (Singing)
Ev'rywhere it's Christmas,
Ev'rywhere it's song.
London, Paris, Rome and New York,
Tokyo, Hong Kong.
Oh, ev'rywhere it's Christmas,
And I'm off to join the cheer!
Ev'rywhere it's Christmas,
At the end of ev'ry year!
Oh, ev'rywhere it's Christmas,
At the end of ev'ry year!
I said that ev'rywhere it's Christmas,
At the end of ev'ry year!
One more time now!
Ev'rywhere it's Christmas....
Orowainya, orowainya, orowainya, ooh,
Endomainya, endomainya, endomainya, ooh.
(G): Our story opens in Corsica. On the verandah is a bearded man in gla**es conducting a small choir.
(All): (Singing)
Orowainya, orowainya, orowainya....
Yohoo! Yodellaihetee! Yohoo!
(R): Meanwhile, high in the Swiss Alps, two elderly Scotchmen munch on a rare cheese.
(G): Wonderful stuff this, Agnes.
(J): Aye, it's wonderful stuff.
(All): (Singing)
Hodellaihetee! Yodellaihetee!
(R): I'm standing in the entrance to the main tent. Immediately behind me, the festivities have already begun.
(J): Tell me, are you enjoying the wine?
(P): I am indeed your Highness. It goes well with me. (*Yeh, very good very good, ha ha ha!?)
(P): The King seems to be enjoying himself tonight! (*You might not have seen him in such good focus since the October festival.?)
(J): (*Alright!?) Is there a doctor here? Is there a doctor around here? Did anybody see one?
(G): At the same time as this, in the captain's mess on board the H.M.S. Tremendous, a toast is being proposed.
(P): To her majesty!
(All): To her majesty!
(*Ho-Ho-Ho-Ho-Ho-Ho-Ho-Ho-Ho!?)
(P): Podgy the bear and Jasper were huddled around the unlit fire in the centre of the room. "There are no more matches left, Podgy," said Jasper. "Then buy some, Jasper, old friend," said Podgy. "Make a list and afterwards we'll go to the shop and buy matches and (*buy?) candles and buns." "There's no more paper to write on, Podgy" "No need to worry, Jasper. You keep saying to yourself 'matches' and I'll keep saying 'candles' until we reach the shop. Then we won't need to write it down. We'll remember." "Who'll remember the buns, Podgy?" "We both will, Jasper ... Matches," "Candles." "Matches." "Candles." "Matches." "Candles." "Matches." "Candles." "Matches." "Candles." 



(J): In the long dark corridors of Felpin Mansions, a door slams and the shadowy figure of Count Balder appears. The Count is the eccentric son of Baron Lndsberg, the inventor of the rack. He speaks "Guten Tagen, meinen damen and herren. Welcome to Felpin Mansions. The butler will show you to your rooms. Butler!" "Yes, sir!" "Show the ladies and gentlemen to their rooms."
(P): Come in.
(J): May I come in?
(P): Come, come in, Count!
(J): May I?
(P): Oh, yes, come in.
(J): Ah, thank you. I was wondering if you knew any of the songs from the good 'ol days.
(P): Oh, my goodness, yes. Don't you worry on that score. I hear the Baron likes, uh, I hear the Baron likes the good old tunes.
(J): Yes, I do.
(P): So do I, Count, so do I. But they're all melodies, aren't they?
(P): No, don't worry. I'll play this one. Do you like this one? Listen to this one.
(P): (Singing)
Please don't bring your banjo bag,
I know where it's been.
I wasn't hardly gone a day
When it became the scene.
Banjos, banjos all the time,
I can't forget that tune.
(All): (Singing)
And if I ever see another banjo,
I'm going out to buy a big balloon,
And if I ever see another banjo,
I'm going out to buy a big balloon,
And if I ever see another banjo,
I'm going out to buy a toy balloon,
And if I ever see another banjo,
I'm going out to buy a toy balloon,
And if I ever see another bloom,
I'm going out to buy a toy balloon,
(P): Yes, everywhere it's Christmas.
(P): (Singing)
Ev'rywhere it's Christmas,
Ev'rywhere it's song.
London, Paris, Rome and New York,
Tokyo, Hong Kong.
Oh, ev'rywhere it's Christmas,
And i'm off to join the cheer!
Ev'rywhere it's Christmas,
At the end of ev'ry year!
Oh, ev'rywhere it's Christmas,
At the end of ev'ry year!
I said that ev'rywhere it's Christmas,
At the end of ev'ry year!
One more time now!
Ev'rywhere it's Christmas,
At the end of ev'ry year,
(P): (*Ha-ha-ha?) Jolly good, (*ho-ho?) jolly good.

I'm pedro the fisherman
I fish by night and day
Unfortunately i live in bristol
Far far away
And there ain't no fish to be caught
No fish to be caught
There ain't no sea
The counseller came



Away from me
I'm pedro the fisherman
With not a fish to fash
Ive got a hook on the line
Big mac
A top
Some red socks
A pair of wellies
And a bit of wine
So im goin to go
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back
In Penny Lane, there is a fireman with an hour gla**
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes 



Four of fish and finger pies in summer
Meanwhile back
Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane
In penny lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello.
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mack
In the pouring rain, very strange.
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies

In penny lane there is a fireman with an hourgla**
And in his pocket is a portrait of the queen.

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt?
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in
Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts?
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in
In their sties with all their backing 



They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking
Everywhere there's lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon
Spoken:
One more time
Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in.
Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in.
In their styes with all their backing



They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking.
Everywhere there's lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon.

Playboy: OK, we're on. Why don't we begin by…
John: Doing Hamlet. [Laughter]
Ringo: Yeah, yeah, let's do that.
Playboy: That sounds like fun, but just for laughs, why don't we do an interview instead?
George: Say, that's a fine idea. I wish I'd thought of that.
Paul: What shall we ask you for a first question?
Ringo: About those Bunny girls…
Playboy: No comment. Let's start over. Ringo, you're the last Beatle to join the group, aren't you?
Ringo: Yes.
Playboy: How long were you fellows working together as a team before Ringo joined up?
John: A few years probably, sort of off and on, really, for three years or so.
Paul: Yeah, but really amateur.
George: The local pub, you know. And in each other's uncles' houses.
John: And at George's brother's wedding. Things like that. Ringo used to fill in sometimes for our drummer.
Playboy: When you joined the others, Ringo, they weren't quite as big as they are now, were they?
Ringo: They were the biggest thing in Liverpool. In them days that was big enough.
Paul: This is a point we've made before. Some people say a man is made of muscle and blood…
No, they don't. They say, "How come you've suddenly been able to adjust to fame, you know, to nationwide fame and things?" It all started quite nicely with us, you see, in our own sphere, where we used to play—in Liverpool. We never used to play outside it, except when we went to Hamburg. Just those two circles. And in each of them, I think we were round the highest paid, and probably at the time the most popular. So in actual fact we had the same feeling of being famous then as we do now.
George: We were recognized then, too, only people didn't chase us about.
Paul: But it just grew. The quantity grew, not the quality of the feeling.
Playboy: When did you know that you had really hit it big? There must have been one night when you knew it had really begun.
John: Well, we'd been playing round in Liverpool for a bit without getting anywhere, trying to get work, and the other groups kept telling us, "You'll do all right, you'll get work someday." And then we went to Hamburg, and when we came back, suddenly we were a wow. Mind you, 70 percent of the audience thought we were a German wow, but we didn't care about that.
Paul: We were billed in the paper: "From Hamburg—The Beatles."
John: In Liverpool, people didn't even know we were from Liverpool. They thought we were from Hamburg. They said, "Christ, they speak good English!" Which we did, of course, being English. But that's when we first, you know, stood there being cheered for the first time.
Paul: That was when we felt we were…
John: …on the way up…
Paul: …gonna make it in Liverpool.
Playboy: How much were you earning then?
John: For that particular night, 20 dollars.
Playboy: Apiece?
John: For the group! Hell, we used to work for a lot less than that.
Paul: We used to work for about three or four dollars a night.
Ringo: Plus all the Coke we could drink. And we drank a lot.
Playboy: Do you remember the first journalist who came to see you and said, "I want to write about you"?
Ringo: We went round to them at first, didn't we?
John: We went and said, "We're a group and we've got this record out. Will you…"
George: And then the door would slam.
Playboy: We've heard it said that when you first went to America you were doubtful that you'd make it over there.
John: That's true. We didn't think we were going to make it at all. It was only Brian telling us we were gonna make it. And George. Brian Epstein, our manager, and George Harrison.
George: I knew we had a good chance—because of the record sales over there.
John: The thing is, in America it just seemed ridiculous—I mean, the idea of having a hit record over there. It was just, you know, something you could never do. That's what I thought, anyhow. But then I realized that it's just the same as here, that kids everywhere all go for the same stuff. And seeing we'd clone it in England and all, there's no reason why we couldn't do it in America, too. But the American disc jockeys didn't know about British records; they didn't play them; nobody promoted them, and so you didn't have hits.
George: Well, there were one or two doing it as a novelty.
John: But it wasn't until Time and Life and Newsweek came over and wrote articles and created an interest in us that the disc jockeys started playing our records. And Capitol said, "Well, can we have their records?" You know, they had been offered our records years ago, and they didn't want them. But when they heard we were big over here they said, "Can we have 'em now?" So we said, "As long as you promote them." So Capitol promoted, and with them and all these articles on us, the records just took off.
Playboy: There's been some dispute, among your fans and critics, about whether you're primarily entertainers or musicians—or perhaps neither. What's your own opinion?
John: We're money-makers first; then we're entertainers.
Ringo: No, we're not.
John: What are we, then?
Ringo: Dunno. Entertainers first.
John: OK.
Ringo: 'Cause we were entertainers before we were money-makers.
John: That's right, of course. It's just that the press drivels it into you, so you say it 'cause they like to hear it, you know?
Paul: Still, we'd be idiots to say that it isn't a constant inspiration to be making a lot of money. It always is, to anyone. I mean, why do big business tycoons stay big business tycoons? It's not because they're inspired at the greatness of big business; they're in it because they're making money at it. We'd be idiots if we pretended we were in it solely for kicks. In the beginning we were, but at the same time, we were hoping to make a bit of cash. It's a switch around now, though, from what it used to be. We used to be doing it mainly for kicks and not making a lot of money, and now we're making money without too many kicks—except that we happen to like the money we're making. But we still enjoy making records, going onstage, making films, and all that business.
John: We love every minute of it, Beatle people!
Playboy: As hard-bitten refugees from the Liverpool slums—according to heartrending fan magazine biographies—do you feel prepared to cope with all this sudden wealth?
Paul: We've managed to make the adjustment. Contrary to rumor, you see, none of us was brought up in any slums or in great degrees of poverty. We've always had enough; we've never been starving.
John: Yeah, we saw these articles in the American fan mags that "Those boys struggled up from the slums…"
George: We never starved. Even Ringo hasn't.
Ringo: Even I.
Playboy: What kind of families do you come from?
George: Well, you know, not rich. Just workin' cla**. They've got jobs. Just work.
Playboy: What does your father do?
George: Well, he doesn't do anything now. He used to be a bus driver…
John: In the Merchant Navy.
Playboy: Do you have any sisters or brothers, George?
George: I've got two brothers.
John: And no sisters to speak of.
Playboy: How about you, Paul?
Paul: I've got one brother, and a father who used to be a cotton salesman down in New Orleans, you know. That's probably why I look a bit tanned. But seriously, folks, he occasionally had trouble paying bills—but it was never, you know, never, "Go out and pick blackberries, son; we're a bit short this week."
Playboy: How about you, John?
John: Oh, just the same. I used to have an auntie. And I had a dad whom I couldn't quite find.
Ringo: John lived with the Mounties.
John: Yeah, the Mounties. They fed me well. No starvation.
Playboy: How about your family, Ringo, old man?
Ringo: Just workin' cla**. I was brought up with my mother and me grandparents. And then she married my stepfather when I was 13. All the time she was working. I never starved. I used to get most things.
George: Never starved?
Ringo: No, I never starved. She always fed me. I was an only child, so it wasn't amazing.
Playboy: It's quite fashionable in some circles in America to hate your parents. But none of you seem to.
Ringo: We're probably just as against the things our parents liked or stood for as they are in America. But we don't hate our parents for it.
Playboy: It's often exactly the opposite in America.
Paul: Well, you know, a lot of Americans are unbalanced. I don't care what you say. No, really. A lot of them are quite normal, of course, but we've met many unbalanced ones. You know the type of person, like the political Whig.
Playboy: How do you mean?
Paul: You know—the professional politician type; in authority sort of thing. Some of them are just mad! And I've met some really maniac American girls! Like this girl who walked up to me in a press conference and said, "I'm Lily." I said, "Hello, how do you do?" and she said, "Doesn't my name mean anything to you?" I said, "Ah, no…" and I thought, "Oh God, it's one of these people that you've met and you should know." And so Derek, our press agent, who happened to be there at the time, hanging over my shoulder, giving me quotes, which happens at every press conference…
George: You better not say that.
Paul: Oh yes, that's not true, Beatle people! But he was sort of hanging about, and he said, "Well, did you ring, or did you write, or something?" And she said, "No." And he said, "Well, how did you get in touch with Paul? How do you know him?" And she said, "Through God." Well, there was sort of a ghastly silence. I mean, we both sort of gulped and blushed. I said, "Well, that's very nice, Lily. Thanks very much. I must be off now."
Playboy: There wasn't a big lightning bolt from the sky?
Paul: No, there wasn't. But I talked to her afterward, and she said she'd got a vision from God and God had said to her…
John: "It's been a hard day's night." [Laughter]
Paul: No, God had said, "Listen, Lil, Paul is waiting for you; he's in love with you and he wants to marry you, so go down and meet him, and he'll know you right away." It's very funny, you know. I was trying to persuade her that she didn't in actual fact have a vision from God, that it was…
George: It was probably somebody disguised as God.
Paul: You wouldn't hardly ever meet somebody like that in England, but there seemed to me to be a lot like her in America.
John: Well, there are a lot more people in America, so you've got a much bigger group to get nutters from.
Playboy: Speaking of nutters, do you ever wake up in the morning, look in the mirror and say, "My God, I'm a Beatle"?
Paul: No, not quite. [Laughter]
John: Actually, we only do it in each other's company. I know I never do it alone.
Ringo: We used to do it more. We'd get in the car, I'd look over at John and say, "Christ, look at you; you're a bloody phenomenon!" and just laugh—'cause it was only him, you know. And a few old friends of ours done it, from Liverpool. I'd catch 'em looking at me, and I'd say, "What's the matter with you?" It's just daft, them just screaming and laughing, thinking I'm one of them people.
Playboy: A Beatle?
Ringo: Yes.
Paul: The thing makes me know we've made it is like tonight, when we slipped into a sweetshop. In the old days we could have just walked into a sweetshop and nobody would have noticed us. We would have just got our sweets and gone out. But tonight we just walked in—it took a couple of seconds—and the people just dropped their sweets. Before, you see, there would have been no reaction at all. Except possibly, "Look at that fellow with the long hair. Doesn't he look daft?" But nowadays they're just amazed; they can't believe it. But actually we're no different.
Playboy: The problem is that you don't seem to be like real people. You're Beatles.
Paul: I know. It's very funny, that.
George: It's all the publicity.
Paul: We're taken in by it, too. Because we react exactly the same way to the stars we meet. When we meet people we've seen on the telly or in films, we still think, "Wow!"
John: It's a good thing, because we still get just as tickled.
Paul: The thing is that people, when they see you on TV and in magazines and up in a film, and hear you on the radio, they never expect to meet you, you know, even our fans. Their wish is to meet you, but in the back of their mind they never think they're actually gonna meet us. And so, when they do meet us, they just don't believe it.
Playboy: Where do they find you—hiding in your hotel rooms?
John: No, on the street, usually.
Playboy: You mean you're brave enough to venture out in the streets without a bodyguard?
Ringo: Sure.
George: We're always on the street. Staggering about.
Ringo: Floggin' our bodies.
George: You catch John sleeping in the gutter occasionally.
Playboy: When people see you in the street, do you ever have any action?
George: Well, not really, because when you're walking about, you don't bump into groups of people, as a rule. People don't walk round in gangs, as a rule.
Playboy: Can you even go out shopping without getting mobbed by them, individually or collectively?
John: We avoid that.
Paul: The mountain comes to Mohammed.
George: The shop comes to us, as he says. But sometimes we just roll into a store and buy the stuff and leg out again.
Playboy: Isn't that like looking for trouble?
Paul: No, we walk four times faster than the average person.
Playboy: Can you eat safely in restaurants?
George: Sure we can. I was there the other night.
John: Where?
George: Restaurants.
Paul: Of course we're known in the restaurants we go in.
George: And usually it's only Americans that'll bother you.
Playboy: Really?
George: Really. If we go into a restaurant in London, there's always going to be a couple of them eating there; you just tell the waiter to hold them off if they try to come over. If they come over anyway, you just sign.
Ringo: But you know, the restaurants I go to, probably if I wasn't famous, I wouldn't go to them. Even if I had the same money and wasn't famous I wouldn't go to them, because the people that go to them are drags. The good thing when you go to a place where the people are such drags, such snobs, you see, is that they won't bother to come over to your table. They pretend they don't even know who you are, and you get away with an easy night.
George: And they think they're laughing at us, but really we're laughing at them. 'Cause we know they know who we are.
Ringo: How's that?
George: They're not going to be like the rest and ask for autographs.
Ringo: And if they do, we just swear at 'em.
George: Well, I don't, Beatle people. I sign the autograph and thank them profusely for coming over and offer them a piece of my chop.
John: If we're in the middle of a meal. I usually say, "Do you mind waiting till I'm finished?"
George: And then we keep eating until they give up and leave.
John: That's not true, Beatle people!
Playboy: Apart from these occupational hazards, are you happy in your work? Do you really enjoy getting pelted by jelly beans and being drowned out by thousands of screaming subteenagers?
Ringo: Yes.
George: We still find it exciting.
John: Well, you know…
Paul: After a while, actually, you begin to get used to it, you know.
Playboy: Can you really get used to this?
Paul: Well, you still get excited when you go onto a stage and the audience is great, you know. But obviously you're not as excited as you were when you first heard that one of your records had reached number one. I mean, you really do go wild with excitement then; you go out drinking and celebrating and things.
Ringo: Now we just go out drinkin' anyway.
Playboy: Do you stick pretty much together offstage?
John: Well, yes and no. Groups like this are normally not friends, you know; they're just four people out there thrown together to make an act. There may be two of them who sort of go off and are friends, you know, but…
George: Just what do you mean by that?
John: Strictly platonic, of course. But we're all rather good friends, as it happens.
Playboy: Then you do see a good deal of one another when you're not working?
Paul: Well, you know, it depends. We needn't always go to the same places together. In earlier days, of course, when we didn't know London, and we didn't know anybody in London, then we really did stick together, and it would really just be like four fellows down from the north for a coach trip. But nowadays, you know, we've got our own girlfriends—they're in London—so that we each normally go out with our girlfriends on our days off. Except for John, of course, who's married.
Playboy: Do any of the rest of you have plans to settle down?
Paul: I haven't got any.
George: Ringo and I are gettin' married.
Playboy: Oh? To whom?
George: To each other. But that's a thing you better keep a secret.
Ringo: You better not tell anybody.
George: I mean, if we said something like that, people'd probably think we're queers. After all, that's not the sort of thing you can put in a reputable magazine like Playboy. And anyway, we don't want to start the rumor going.
Playboy: We'd better change the subject, then. Do you remember the other night when this girl came backstage…
George: Naked…
Playboy: Unfortunately not. And she said…
George: "It's been a hard day's night."
Playboy: No, she pointed at you, George, and said, "There's a Beatle!" And you others said, "That's George." And she said, "No, it's a Beatle!"
John: And you said, "This way to the bedroom."
Playboy: No, it was, "Would you like us to introduce you to him?"
John: I like my line better.
Playboy: Well, the point is that she didn't believe that there was such a thing as an actual Beatle person.
John: She's right, you know.
Playboy: Do you run across many like her?
George: Is there any other kind?
Playboy: In America, too?
Ringo: Everywhere.
Playboy: With no exceptions?
John: In America, you mean?
Playboy: Yes.
John: A few.
Paul: Yeah. Some of those American girls have been great.
John: Like Joan Baez.
Paul: Joan Baez is good, yeah, very good.
John: She's the only one I like.
George: And Jayne Mansfield, Playboy made her.
Paul: She's a bit different, isn't she? Different.
Ringo: She's soft.
George: Soft and warm.
Paul: Actually, she's a clot.
Ringo: Says Paul, the god of the Beatles.
Paul: I didn't mean it, Beatle people! Actually, I haven't even met her. But you won't print that anyway, of course, because Playboy is very pro-Mansfield. They think she's a rave. But she really is an old bag.
Playboy: By the way, what are Beatle people?
John: It's something they use in the fan mags in America. They all start out, "Hi there, Beatle people, 'spect you're wondering what the Fab Foursome are doing these days!" Now we use it all the time, too.
Paul: It's low-level journalese.
John: But I mean, you know, there's nothing wrong with that. It's harmless.
Playboy: Speaking of low-level journalese, there was a comment in one of the London papers the other day that paralleled you guys with Hitler. Seriously! It said that you have the same technique of drawing cheers from the crowd…



Paul: That power isn't so much us being like Hitler; it's that the audiences and the show have got sort of, you know, a Hitler feel about them, because the audience will shout when they're told to. That's what that critic was talking about. Actually, that article was one which I really got annoyed about, 'cause she's never even met us.
Playboy: She?
Paul: The woman who wrote it. She's never met us, but she was dead against us. Like that Hitler bit. And she said we were very boring people. "The Boresome Foursome," she called us. You know, really, this woman was really just shouting her mouth off about us—as people, I mean.
Ringo: Oh, come on.
Paul: No, you come on. I rang up the newspaper, you know, but they wouldn't let me speak to her. In actual fact, they said, "Well, I'll tell you, the reason we don't give her phone number out is because she never likes to speak to people on the phone because she's got a terrible stutter."
So I never did actually follow it up. Felt sorry for her. But I mean, the cheek of her, writing this damn article about us. And telling everybody how we're starting riots, and how we were such bores—and she's never even met us, mind you! I mean, we could turn around and say the same about her! I could go and thump her!
George: ba*tard fascist!
Playboy: Ringo…
Ringo: Yes, Playboy, sir?
Playboy: How do you feel about the press? Has your attitude changed in the last year or so?
Ringo: Yes.
Playboy: In what way?
Ringo: I hate 'em more now than I did before.
Playboy: Did you hear about the riot in Glasgow on the night of your last show there?
John: We heard about it after.
Playboy: Did you know that the next day there was a letter in one of the Glasgow papers that accused you of directly inciting the violence?
Ringo: How can they say that about us? We don't even wiggle. It's not bloody fair.
George: ba*tards!
Paul: Glasgow is like Belfast. There'll probably be a bit of a skirmish there, too. But it's not because of us. It's because people in certain cities just hate the cops more than in other cities.
George: Right.
Paul: There were ridiculous riots last time we were there—but it wasn't riots for us. The crowd was there for us, but the riots after our show…
Ringo: All the drunks come out, out of the pubs.
Paul: …It was just beatin' up coppers.
Playboy: They just used the occasion as a pretext to get at the cops?
George: Yeah.
Paul: In Dublin this trip, did you see where the crowd sort of stopped all the traffic? They even pulled a driver out of a bus.
John: They also called out the fire brigade. We had four fire engines this time.
Playboy: People were also overturning cars and breaking shop windows. But all this had nothing to do with your show?
Paul: Well, it's vaguely related, I suppose. It's got something to do with it, inasmuch as the crowds happen to be there because of our show.
John: But nobody who's got a bit of common sense would seriously think that 15-year-old girls are going round smashing shop windows on account of us.
George: Certainly not. Those girls are eight years old.
Playboy: This talk of violence leads to a related question. Do you guys think there'll be another war soon?
George: Yeah. Friday.
Ringo: I hope not. Not just after we've got our money through the taxes.
John: The trouble is, if they do start another war, then everybody goes with you.
Playboy: Do you think the Rolling Stones will be the first to go?
Paul: It won't matter, 'cause we'll probably be in London or Liverpool at the time, and when they drop the bomb, it'll be in the middle of the city. So we probably won't even know it when it happens.
Playboy: We brought this up for a reason, fellows. There was an essay not long ago in a very serious commentary magazine, saying that before every major war in this century, there has been a major wave of public hysteria over certain specific entertainers. There was the Irene Castle craze before World War One…
Paul: Oh, yes.
George: I remember that well.
Playboy: And then; before World War Two, there was the swing craze, with Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw, and all the dancing in the aisles. And now you—before…
John: Hold on! It's not our fault!
Playboy: We're not saying you may have anything to do with inciting a war…
Paul: Thanks.
Playboy: But don't you think you may be a symptom of the times, part of an undercurrent that's building up?
Paul: That sort of comparison just falls down when you look at it, really. It's just like saying that this morning a fly landed on my bed and that I looked at my watch and it was eight o'clock, and that therefore every morning at eight o'clock flies land on the bed. It doesn't prove anything just 'cause it happens a few times.
Playboy: Let's move on to another observation about you. Did you know that the Duke of Edinburgh was recently quoted as saying that he thought you were on your way out?
John: Good luck, Duke.
George: No comment. See my manager.
Paul: He didn't say it, though. There was a retraction, wasn't there?
John: Yeah, we got a telegram. Wonderful news.
Paul: We sent one back. Addressed to "Liz and Phil."
Playboy: Have you ever met the Queen?
John: No, she's the only one we haven't met. We've met all the others.
Paul: All the mainstays.
Playboy: Winston Churchill?
Ringo: No, not him.
John: He's a good lad, though.
Playboy: Would you like to meet him?
George: Not really. Not more than anybody else.
Paul: I dunno. Somebody like that you wish you could have met when he was really at his peak, you know, and sort of doing things and being great. But there wouldn't be a lot of point now, because he's sort of gone into retirement and doesn't do a lot of things anymore.
Playboy: Is there any celebrity you would like to meet?
Paul: I wouldn't mind meeting Adolf Hitler.
George: You could have every room in your house papered.
Playboy: Would you like to meet Princess Margaret?
Paul: We have.
Playboy: How do you like her?
Ringo: OK. And Philip's OK, too.
Playboy: Even after what he supposedly said about you?
Ringo: I don't care what he said; I still think he's OK. He didn't say nothing about me personally.
Paul: Even if he had said things about us, it doesn't make him worse, you know.
Playboy: Speaking of royalty…
Paul: Royalty never condemns anything unless it's something that they know everybody else condemns.
Ringo: If I was royal…
Paul: If I was royal I would crack long jokes and get a mighty laugh. If I was royal.
George: What would we do with Buckingham Palace? Royalty's stupid.
Playboy: You guys seem to be pretty irreverent characters. Are any of you churchgoers?
John: No.
George: No.
Paul: Not particularly. But we're not antireligious. We probably seem to be antireligious because of the fact that none of us believe in God.
John: If you say you don't believe in God, everybody a**umes you're antireligious, and you probably think that's what we mean by that. We're not quite sure what we are, but I know that we're more agnostic than atheistic.
Playboy: Are you speaking for the group or just for yourself?
John: For the group.
George: John's our official religious spokesman.
Paul: We all feel roughly the same. We're all agnostics.
John: Most people are, anyway.
Ringo: It's better to admit it than to be a hypocrite.
John: The only thing we've got against religion is the hypocritical side of it, which I can't stand. Like the clergy is always moaning about people being poor, while they themselves are all going around with millions of quid worth of robes on. That's the stuff I can't stand.
Paul: A new bronze door stuck on the Vatican.
Ringo: Must have cost a mighty penny.
Paul: But believe it or not, we're not anti-Christ.
Ringo: Just anti-Pope and anti-Christian.
Paul: But you know, in America…
George: They were more shocked by us saying we were agnostics.
John: They went potty; they couldn't take it. Same as in Australia, where they couldn't stand us not liking sports.
Paul: In America they're fanatical about God. I know somebody over there who said he was an atheist. The papers nearly refused to print it because it was such shocking news that somebody could actually be an atheist. Yeah, and admit it.
Ringo: He speaks for all of us.
Playboy: To bring up another topic that's shocking to some, how do you feel about the h*mos**ual problem?
George: Oh yeah, well, we're all h*mos**uals, too.
Ringo: Yeah, we're all queer.
Paul: But don't tell anyone.
Playboy: Seriously, is there more h*mos**uality in England than elsewhere?
John: Are you saying there's more over here than in America?
Playboy: We're just asking.
George: It's just that they've got crewcuts in America. You can't spot 'em.
Paul: There's probably a million more queers in America than in England. England may have its scandals—like Profumo and all—but at least they're heteros**ual.
John: Still, we do have more than our share of queers, don't you think?
Paul: It just seems that way because there's more printed about them over here.
Ringo: If they find out that somebody is a bit bent, the press will always splash it about.
Paul: Right. Take Profumo, for example. He's just an ordinary…
Ringo: Sex maniac.
Paul: …just an ordinary fellow who sleeps with women. Yet it's adultery in the eyes of the law, and it's an international incident. But in actual fact, if you check up on the statistics, you find that there are hardly any married men who've been completely faithful to their wives.
John: I have! Listen, Beatle people…
Paul: All right, we all know John's spotless. But when a thing like that gets into the newspapers, everybody goes very, very Puritan, and they pretend that they don't know what s** is about.
George: They get so bloody virtuous all of a sudden.
Paul: Yes, and some poor heel has got to take the brunt of the whole thing. But in actual fact, if you ask the average Briton what they really think of the Profumo case, they'd probably say, "He was knockin' off some bird. So what?"
Playboy: Incidentally, you've met Mandy Rice-Davies, haven't you?
George: What are you looking at me for?
Playboy: Because we hear she was looking at you.
John: We did meet Christine Keeler.
Ringo: I'll tell you who I met. I met what's-her-name—April Ashley.
John: I met her, too, the other night.
Playboy: Isn't she the one who used to be a man, changed her s** and married into the nobility?
John: That's the one.
Ringo: She swears at me, you know. But when she sobers up she apologizes.
John: Actually, I quite like her. Him. It. That.
Paul: The trouble with saying something like, "Profumo was just a victim of circumstances" or "April Ashley isn't so bad, even though she's changed s**"—saying things like that in print to most people seems so shocking; whereas in actual fact, if you really think about it, it isn't. Just saying a thing like that sounds much more shocking than it is.
Ringo: I got up in the Ad Lib the other night and a big handbag hit me in the gut. I thought it was somebody I knew; I didn't have any gla**es on. I said, "Hello," and a bloody big worker "Arrgghhh." So I just ran into the bog. Because I'd heard about things like that.
Playboy: What are you talking about?
George: He doesn't know.
Playboy: Do you?
George: Haven't the slightest.
Playboy: Can you give us a hint, Ringo? What's the Ad Lib, for example?
Ringo: It's a club.
George: Like your Peppermint Lounge, and the Whisky à GoGo. It's the same thing.
Paul: No, the English version is a little different.
John: The Whisky à GoGo is exactly the same, isn't it, only they have someone dancing on the ceiling, don't they?
George: Don't be ridiculous. They have two girls dancing on the roof; and in the Ad Lib they have a colored chap. That's the difference.
Playboy: We heard a rumor that one of you was thinking of opening a club.
John: I wonder who it was, Ringo.
Ringo: I don't know, John. There was a rumor, yes. I heard that one, too.
Playboy: Is there any truth to it?
Ringo: Well, yes. We was going to open one in Hollywood, but it fell through.
John: Dino wouldn't let you take the place over.
Ringo: No.
Paul: And we decided it's not worth it. So we decided to sit tight for six months and then buy…
George: America.
Playboy: Have you heard about the Playboy Club that's opening in London?
Ringo: Yes, I've heard about it.
Playboy: What do you think of our Clubs?
Ringo: They're for dirty old men, not for the likes of us—dirty young men. They're for businessmen that sneak out without their wives knowing, or if their wives sneak out first, for those who go out openly.
George: There's no real fun in a Bunny's fluffy tail.
Playboy: Then you don't think a Club will make it here?
George: Oh yes, 'course it will.
Ringo: There's enough dirty old men here.
Playboy: Have you ever read the magazine?
John: Yes.
George: Yes.
Ringo: I get my copy every month. Tits.
Playboy: Do you read the [The Playboy] Philosophy, any of you?
Paul: Some of it. When the journey's really long and you can't last out the pictures, you start reading it. It's OK.
Playboy: How about Playboy's Jazz Poll? Do you read it, too?
John: Occasionally.
Playboy: Do you enjoy jazz, any of you?
George: What kind?
Playboy: American jazz.
John: Who, for example?
Playboy: You tell us.
Paul: We only dig those who dig us.
Playboy: Seriously, who? Anyone?
John: Getz. But only because somebody gave me an album of his. With him and somebody called Iguana, or something like that.
Playboy: You mean João Gilberto?
John: I don't know. Some Mexican.
Playboy: He's Brazilian.
John: Oh.
Playboy: Are you guys getting tired of talking?
John: No.
Paul: No, let's order some drinks. Scotch or Coke?
John: I'll have chocolate.
George: Scotch for me and Paul and chocolate for the Beatle teenager.
John: Scotch is bad for your kidneys.
Paul: How about you, Ringo? Don't you want something to keep you awake while you're listening to all this rubbish?
Ringo: I'll have a Coke.
John: How about you, Playboy, are you man or woman?
Paul: It's a Beatle people!
George: Who's your fave rave?
Paul: I love you!
George: How gear.
Playboy: Speaking of fave raves, why do you think the rock-'n'-roll phenomenon is bigger in England than in America?
John: Is it?
Paul: Yes. You see, in England, after us, you have thousands of groups coming out everywhere, but in America they've just sort of had the same groups going for ages. Some have made it and some haven't, but there aren't really any new ones. If we'd been over there instead of over here, there probably would have been the same upsurge over there. Our road manager made an interesting point the other day about this difference in America. In America the people who are the big stars are not our age. There's nobody who's a really big star around our age. Possibly it may seem like a small point, but there's no conscription—no draft—here. In America we used to hear about somebody like Elvis, who was a very big star and then suddenly he was off in the Army.
John: And the Everly Brothers.
Paul: Yes, the Everly Brothers as well went into the Army at the height of their fame. And the Army seems to do something to singers. It may make them think that what they're playing is stupid and childish. Or it may make them want to change their style, and consequently they may not be as popular when they come out of the Army. It may also make people forget them, and consequently they may have a harder job getting back on top when they get out. But here, of course, we don't have that problem.
John: Except those who go to prison.
Paul: It's become so easy to form a group nowadays, and to make a record, that hundreds are doing it—and making a good living at it. Whereas when we started, it took us a couple of years before the record companies would even listen to us, never mind give us a contract. But now, you just walk in and if they think you're OK, you're on.
Playboy: Do you think you had anything to do with bringing all this about?
John: It's a damn fact.
Paul: Not only us. Us and people who followed us. But we were the first really to get national coverage because of some big shows that we did, and because of a lot of public interest in us.
Playboy: What do you think is the most important element of your success—the personal appearances or the records?
John: Records. Records always have been the main thing. P.A.s follow records. Our first records were made, and then we appeared.
Playboy: Followed closely by Beatle dolls. Have you seen them?
George: They're actually life size, you know.
Playboy: The ones we've seen are only about five inches high.
Paul: Well, we're midgets, you see.
Playboy: How does it make you feel to have millions of effigies of yourselves decorating bedsides all over the world? Don't you feel honored to have been immortalized in plastic? After all, there's no such thing as a Frank Sinatra doll or an Elvis Presley doll.
George: Who'd want an ugly old crap doll like that?
Playboy: Would you prefer a George doll, George?
George: No, but I've got a Ringo doll at home.
Playboy: Did you know that you're probably the first public figures to have dolls made of them—except maybe Yogi Berra?
John: In Jellystone Park. Do you mean the cartoon?
Playboy: No. Didn't you know that the cartoon character is based on a real person—Yogi Berra, the baseball player?
George: Oh.
Playboy: Didn't you know that?
John: I didn't know that.
Paul: Well, they're making us into a cartoon, too, in the States. It's a series.
John: The highest achievement you could ever get.
Paul: We feel proud and humble.
Playboy: Did you know, George, that at the corner of 47th Street and Broadway in New York, there is a giant cutout of you on display?
George: Of me?
Playboy: Life size.
Ringo: Nude.
Playboy: No—but the reason we mention it is that this is really a signal honor. For years on that corner, there's been a big store with life-size cutouts of Marilyn Monroe, Anita Ekberg or Jayne Mansfield in the window.
John: And now it's George.
Paul: The only difference is they've got bigger tits.
Ringo: I suppose that's one way of putting it.
George: The party's getting rough. I'm going to go to bed. You carry on, though; I'll just stop my ears with cotton—so as not to hear the insults and the smutty language.
Playboy: We've just about run out of steam anyway.
John: Do you have all you need?
Playboy: Enough. Many thanks, fellows.
John: 'Course a lot of it you won't be able to use—"crap" and "bloody" and "tit" and "ba*tard" and all.
Playboy: Wait and see.
Ringo: Finish your Scotch before you go.
John: You don't mind if I climb into bed, do you? I'm frazzled.
Playboy: Not at all. Good night.
Ringo: Good night, Playboy.
George: It's been a hard day's night.

Ready - set - go man go
I got a gal that I love so
I'm ready - ready ready Teddy
I'm ready - ready ready Teddy
I'm ready - ready ready Teddy
I'm ready ready ready to rock 'n' roll
Goin' down to the corner, pick up my sweetie pie
She's my rock 'n' roll baby, she's the apple of my eye (chorus)
Well, the flat top cats and the dungaree dolls



Are headed for the gym to the sock hop ball
The joint is really jumpin', the cats are goin' wild
The music really sends me, I dig that crazy style (chorus)
Gonna kick off my shoes, roll up my faded jeans
Grab my rock 'n' roll baby, pour on the steam
I shuffle to the left, I shuffle to the right
Gonna rock 'n' roll 'til the early early night
All my little plans and schemes,
Lost like some forgotten dreams,
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for you.
Just like little girls and boys,
Playing with their little toys.
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for love.
Don't need to be alone,
No need to be alone.
It's real love, it's real.
Yes it's real love, it's real.
From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go.
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love.
Don't need to be afraid,



No need to be afraid.
It's real love, it's real.
Yes it's real love, it's real.
Thought I'd been in love before,
But in my heart, I wanted more.
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you.
Don't need to be alone,
Don't need to be alone.
It's real love, it's real.
It's real love, it's real.
Yes it's real love, it's real.
It's real love, it's real.

I forgot to remember to forget her
I can't seem to get her off my mind
I thought I'd never miss her
But I've found out somehow
I think about her almost all the time
Well the day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we'd ever met



But something sure is wrong
'cause I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget
Well the day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we'd ever met
But something sure is wrong
'cause I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget.
I'm just sitting here reminiscing
Wondering who you've been kissing, baby, oh oh baby
I've been wandering all around
There must be a new guy in town
You don't love me anymore
I'll get over you baby
Although my heart's still sore
You know my heart's still sore
Well, I think of all the lies you told



You're a junk man, my heart you sold
You're a cheater and a mean mis treater
When I think of all the fun we had
Kind of makes me feel so sad
And I'm lonely for your love and as long as I live
It's only you I'll be thinking of
It's you I'm thinking of
It's you I'm thinking of
You say you want a revolution

As the headmaster reported to me
My son he really can try as they do to find function 



Who could tell what he was saying, and his voice was low and his hive was high
And his eyes were low
All right!
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9,
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9,
Number 9, number 9, number 9
So the wife called, and we'd better go to see a surgeon
Or whatever to price it
Right!
Yellow underclothes
So, any road, we went to see the dentist instead 
Who gave her a pair of teeth which wasn't any good at all
So I said I'd marry, join the bloody Navy and went to sea
In my broken chair, my wings are broken and so is my hair
I am not in the mood for wearing
Um da
Aaah
How?
The dogs were dogging, the cats were catting
The birds were birding, and the fish were fishing
The men were themming, and the when were whimming
Only to find the night-watchman
Unaware of his presence in the building
Onion soup
Number 9, number 9, number 9,
Number 9, number 9, number 9
Industrial output
Financial imbalance
Thrusting it between his shoulder blades
The Watusi
The Twist
El Dorado
Take this, brother, may it serve you well
Maybe it's nothing
Aaah
Maybe it's not that; it's
What? What? Oh
Maybe even then
Exposures in London
It's a difficulty being
By exposure
Because it's almost like being naked
If you become naked
That line
Hold that line
Hold that line
Hold that line
Hold that line
Block that kick
Block that kick
Block that kick
Block that kick
Block that kick
Block that kick
Block that kick
Block that kick
Block that kick

[Verse 1]
You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out, in
Don't you know it's going to be all right
All right, all right
[Verse 2]
You say you got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well, you know
We're doing what we can
But when you want money
For people with minds that hate
All I can tell is brother you have to wait



Don't you know it's going to be all right
All right, all right
Ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...
[Verse 3]
You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You better free you mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of chairman Mao
You aren't going to make it with anyone anyhow
Don't you know it's going to be all right
All right, all right
All right, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right
[Speech]
[Brian Matthew:] Before we hear another song, fellows, there is a few things I'd like to ask you. First of all, do you ever get tired of being Beatles?
[Paul:] We don't think so, really.
[Brian:] You don't ever think that?
[Paul:] Just occasionally, you get cheesed off with people writing rubbing about you, which you get often.
[John:] Yeah, I agree with that. I've had a divorce and half a dozen kids.
[Brian:] Now, what do you, eh, well, I mean, doesn't, isn't this a big sort of drag to go around explaining to your wife that you're not divorced and all that sort of things?
[John:] No, she knows I'm not divorced, 'cause I keep seeing her every day, you see.



[Brian:] Yes, a point, but what about the simpler things of life, like, eh--"
[Paul:] Like riding a bus?
[Brian:] Yeah, or going to just about any restaurant you--
[Paul:] Well, yeah, you miss those sort of things.
[John:] We go to certain ones.
[George:] And we go to ones where the people there are so snobby, they're the type who pretend they don't know us, so we have a good time, 'cause they pretend they don't know us.
[Paul:] Joe's CafAc!
[Brian:] Yeah, that figures.
[Paul:] Joe's CafAc! Social statement, that, you know.
[George:] It is.

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock-roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until it sounds just like a symphony
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock-roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I took my love on over 'cross the tracks
And she declaim a man a wailin' sax
I must admit they had a rockin' band
Man, they were blowin' like a hurrican'
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it 



Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Way down South they had a jubilee
Them Georgia folks they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' homebrew from a wooden cup
The folks were dancin' and got all shook up
And started playin' that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock-roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Don't care to hear them play a tango
I'm in no mood to take a mambo
It's way too early for a congo
So keep on rockin' that piano
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a black beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Oughta got rock-roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it,
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me

I've got no kick against modern jazz

Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it,
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man, they were goin' like a hurrican'
That's why i go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it,



Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Way down south they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' home brew from a water cup
The folks dancin' got all shook up
And started playin' that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it,
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
I'm in the mood to gear a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin' that piano
So i can gear some of that
Rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it,
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy name o' Rocky Raccoon-a
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, "I'm gonna get that boy"
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon
Rocky Raccoon
Checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Rocky had come
Equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival, it seems
Had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill
And she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now, she and her man
Who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown
A-Rocky burst in
And grinning a grin
He said, "Danny, boy, this is a showdown!"
But Daniel was hot
And he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner
Aah

Doo-doodle-doo doo-doodle-doo
La-ta ndoo dloo-doo-doo
Now the doctor came in
Stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, "Rocky, you met your match"
And Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better
I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able"
A-now Rocky Raccoon
He fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible (Daa da-da-da)
A-Gideon checked out (Poor)
And he left it no doubt (Rocky)
To help with good Rocky's revival (Ohhh)
Aah
Oh, yeah, yeah'n

Creme tangerine, Montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
Coffee dessert, yes, you know it's good news
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
Cool cherry cream, nice apple tart
I feel your taste all the time we're apart
Coconut fudge really blows down those blues (whoo)
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
You might not feel it now
When the pain cuts through
You're gonna know, and how!
The sweat is gonna fill your head (whoa)
When it becomes too much, you'll shout aloud 



But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
You know that what you eat you are
But what is sweet now turns so sour
We all know o-bla-di-bla-da
But can you show me where you are?
Creme tangerine and Montelimar

You're going to know and how



The sweat is going to fill your head

You're going to shout aloud

The leaves of brown
Came tumbling down,
Remember in September in the rain.
The sun went out
Just like a light,
Remember in September in the rain.
To every word
Of love I heard you whisper
The raindrops seems
To play a sweet refrain.
Thought it's spring,
To me it's still September,



Oh that September in the rain.
To every word
Of love I heard you whisper
The raindrops seems
To play a sweet refrain.
Thought it's spring,
To me it's still September,
Oh that September in the rain.
I said I said it's September in the rain.
Ah September in the rain.

Wednesday morning at five o'clock
As the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen
Clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the back door key
Stepping outside she is free
She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye bye)
For so many years
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
"Daddy, our baby's gone" 



Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?
She (We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye bye)
For so many years
Friday morning at nine o'clock
She is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade
She (What did we do that was wrong?)
Is having (We didn't know it was wrong)
Fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied (Bye bye)
For so many years
She's leaving home
Bye bye

In black and white
They really really ought to know
Those one track minds
That took you for a working boy
Kiss them goodbye
You shouldn't have to jump for joy
You shouldn't have to shout for joy
Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on
They gave you life



And in return you gave them hell
As cold as ice
I hope we live to tell the tale
I hope we live to tell the tale
Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on
Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on
And when you've taken down your guard
If I could change your mind
I'd really love to break your heart
I'd really love to break your heart
Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on
You know you want to make me:

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how



You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know, I don't know
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover

Something in her style that shows me
Don't want to leave her now

Don't want to leave her now

Someday, somewhere
Someday, somewhere
We'll find a new way of living
Will find a way of forgiving
Somewhere...
There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
Wait for us
Somewhere
There's a time for us
Someday there'll be a time for us
Time together and time to spare
Time to learn, time to care



Someday, somewhere
We'll find a new way of living
Will find there's a way of forgiving
Somewhere... Somewhere... Somewhere...
There's a place for us
A time and a place for us
Hold my hand and we're half way there
Just hold my hand and I'll take you there
Somehow...
Someday, somewhere...
If your life's not right, doesn't satisfy you
Don't get the breaks like some of us do
Better work it out, find where you've gone wrong
Better do it soon as you don't have long
Get out of Sour Milk Sea
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on there
If you want the most from everything you do
In the shortest time your dreams come true
In no time at all it makes you more aware
Very simple process takes you there



Get out of Sour Milk Sea
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on there
Looking for release from limitation
There's nothing much without illumination
Can fool around with every different cult
There's only one way brings results
Get out of Sour Milk Sea
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on there
Wise: Boys! And what I was thinking was, er ... would you like to do a number with us, you know, we'd like to do a number together
Beatles: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Wise: You fancy that? Great!
Morecambe: Yeah-eh! It's the Kay sisters, they've come! Great! Fabulous!
Wise: The Kay sisters?! This is...
Morecambe: Look, they've dyed their hair!
Wise: ...this is the Beatles!
Morecambe: Hello, Beatle! Where is he?
Wise: Where is he?
Morecambe: There he is! Hello, Bongo! Hey.
Wise: That's Ringo!
Morecambe: Oh, is he there as well? ... oh dear
Wise : Boys!
Morecambe: By golly!
Wise: As you can gather this is Eric. Say hello to Eric.
Morecambe: Yes.
Paul: Hello, Eric!
Morecambe: Hello, mate!
Paul: I remember you, you're the one with the short fat hairy legs!
Morecambe: No, no, no. It's... no, he's the one with the short fat hairy legs. No, him.
Wise: Yeah.
George: We're the ones with the big fat hairy heads. Get out of that!
[George puts his hand (opened flat, palm down, under Eric M's chin when saying "Get out of that".) That was Eric's trick on Ernie (a running gag). "Get out of that, eh? You can't can you!!". If that's not funny to you, you had to be there!]
Morecambe: Hey! Hey-hey! What's it like being famous?
John: Well, it's not like in your day, you know.
[John, insulting them, by saying they are oldies with this remark! Makes a gesture of "very far away" with his hands]
Morecambe: Ha! That was an insult, that is!
Morecambe: You didn't expect that, did you?
Wise: No!
Morecambe: What do you mean "not like in my day"?



John: Well, me dad used to tell me about you, you know.
[John indicated with his hand how tall he was, when his Dad told him ... just a little kid. Eric misunderstands (deliberately) ...
Paul: ... In the old days.
Morecambe: You've only got a little dad have you?
Morecambe: [mocking] Yer dad used to tell yer, that's a bit strong, innit? Alright, Bonzo!
Wise: That's Ringo!
Morecambe: Yeah, him as well!
Morecambe: Get 'em off, you've done enough.
[Pretending their "time slot" is up, get them off the stage, or done enough damage with their behaviour :) ]
Wise: What do you mean "done enough"?
Morecambe: No, well I'm getting insulted now ...
Wise: No. Look, what I was going to suggest was let's do a number with the boys!
Morecambe: Oh yes! One that the dad will remember. That I used to do, with your dad.
Wise: You go and get changed.
Morecambe: Yes, I will, right.
Wise: What do you think we should do, boys? What about something that's more suitable for Eric's age?
John: "Moonlight Bay".
Wise: "Moonlight Bay".
John: Yeah.
Wise: So ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna make history on television. For the first time we have Morecambe and Wise and the Beatles presenting to you that wonderful old fashioned number "Moonlight Bay". You all remember the number. Okay, fellows, that's great, you look marvellous! You ready?
John/Paul: Aye
Paul: Alright, ready.
Wise: Alright, we'll take it from the top.
Wise: Okay, Kenny, thank you

So darling, darling stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand by, oh stand, stand by me
If the sky that we look upon



Should tumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry
No I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
Whenever you're in trouble would you stand by me?
Oh, stand by
Oh, stand by, oh stand, stand by me

Way down upon the Swanee River
Far, far away
That's where my heart is yearning ever
Home where the old folks stay
Way down upon the Swanee River
Far, far away-hey
Whoa, that's where my heart is yearning ever
Home where the old folks stay
All up and down the whole creation
Sadly I roam
I'm a still a-longin' for the old plantation
Oh, for the old folks at home
Ah-oh-oh!
Oh, my my!
Well, way down upon the Swanee River
Far, far away-hey



Whoa, that's where my heart is yearning ever
Home where the old folks stay
All up and down the whole creation
Sadly I roam
I'm still a-longin' for the old plantation
And for the old folks at home
All the world is sad and dreary
Ev'rywhere I roam
Oh, darkies, how my heart grows weary
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home

Well let me tell you well no chick made
Could be the same
As Sweet Georgia Brown.
Crazy feet that dance so neat
Has sweet Georgia Brown.
Fella's sigh, and even cry
For sweet Georgia Brown.
I tell you just why
You know I don't lie.
It's been said
She knocks them dead
In any old town.
Since she came right
It's a shame
How she brings them down.
In Liverpool she even dare
To critize the Beatles' hair.
With their whole fanclub
Standing there
I mean sweet Georgia Brown.
I say this group is absolutely marvellous with the piano, don't you



Think so. Not too commercial, boys, not too commercial!
When it comes to music
Sweet Georgia is known to mind,
Don't buy clothes at fashion shows
But she still looks fine
Snap chicks cry,
They want to die
When Georgie does the twist
I never would try
To tell you just why.
Use your imagination
There's a DJ crazy for her
Living in out home town
Since she came it's a shame
She turns him down
Records that she can get
Are records, they ain't sent him yet
Carolina may have Dina,
But that don't have Georgia Brown.

As I was slowly pa**ing
An orphan's home one day,
I stopped for just a little while
To watch the children play.
Alone a boy was standing
And when I asked him why,
He turned with eyes that could not see
And he began to cry.
I'm nobody's child,
I'm nobody's child.
Just like the flowers
I'm growing wild.
I got no mummy's kisses



I got no daddy's smile.
Nobody wants me,
I'm nobody's child.
No mummy's arms to hold me
Or sue me when I cry,
'cause sometimes I feel so lonesome
I wish that I could die.
I'll walk the streets of heaven
Where all blinds can see.
And just like for the other kids
It will be a home for me.
If you leave me baby,
I don't know what i'll do.
I guess i would die, sweetheart
If i don't get a kiss from you.
Take out some insurance on me baby,
Take out some insurance on me baby.
Well if you ever ever say goodbye,
I'm gonna walk right back and die.
Oh if you want me baby,
You got to come to me.
I'm just like a string feeling,
You just can't lose me.
Take out some insurance on me baby,
Ooo some insurance on me baby.
Well if you ever ever say goodbye,
I'm gonna walk right over and die.
Well if you want me baby,



Mm you got to come to me.
I'm just like a strong feeling,
You just can't lose me.
Take out some insurance on me baby,
Mm some insurance on me baby.
Well if you ever ever say goodbye,
I'm gonna walk right over and die.
Well if you leave me baby,
I don't know what i'll do.
I guess i would die, sweetheart,
If i don't get a kiss from you.
Take out some insurance on me baby,
Ooo some goddamn insurance on me baby.
If you ever ever say goodbye,
I'm gonna walk right over and die.

Standing in the dock at Southampton
Trying to get to Holland or France
The man in the mac said
"You've got to go back."
You know, they didn't even give us a chance
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me
Finally made the plane into Paris
Honeymooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown called to say
You can make it okay
You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The news people said
"Say, what you doing in bed?"
I said, "We're only trying to get us some peace"
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going 



They're going to crucify me
Saving up your money for a rainy day
Giving all your clothes to charity
Last night the wife said
"Oh boy, when you're dead
You don't take nothing with you but your soul
Think!"
Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating chocolate cake in a bag
Newspapers said
"She's gone to his head.
They look just like two gurus in drag."
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me
Caught the early plane back to London
Fifty acorns tied in a sack
The men from the press
Said, "We wish you success.
It's good to have the both of you back."
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me
Standing in the dock at southampton,
Trying to get to holland or france.
The man in the mac said, "you've got to turn back".
You know they didn't even give us a chance.
Christ you know it ain't easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me.
Finally made the plane into paris,
Honey mooning down by the seine.
Peter brown called to say,
"you can make it o.k.,
You can get married in gibraltar, near spain".

You don't take nothing with you
But your soul - think!"

(R): Hello, this is a big "Hi" and a sincere Merry Christmas from yours truly, Ringo Starr.
(P): (Singing)
Happy New Year, happy Christmas,
Happy Easter, happy autumn.
Happy Michelmas, ev'rybody,
Happy Christmas, ev'rybody to you.
I'd like to wish ev'rybody happy Christmas
This year of 1968 going on 69.
Happy Christmas, happy New Year,
All the best to you from here.
Ah - haaa!
I'd like to wish ev'rybody
Happy Christmas, happy New Year.
From there to here,
Happy New Year, happy New Year,
Happy New Year, happy New Year.
When I get to the bottom
I go back to the top of the slide,
Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again.
(J): Once upon a time, there were two balloons called
Jock and Yono. They were strictly in love, bound to happen
in a million years. They were together man. Unfortunate
timetable, they seemed to have previous experience which
kept calling them one way or another. You know how it is.
But they battled on against overwhelming oddities,
including some of their beast friends. Being in love,
they clung together even more man. But some of the
poisonous monsters' outdated boss - lordy ape claws did
stick slightly, and they occasionally had to resort to
the dry cleaners. Luckily, this did not k** them and
they weren't banned form the Olympic Games. They lived
hopefully ever after and who could blame them?
(G): Well, here we are again, another fab Christmas. Christmas
time is here again. Ain't been around since last year.
And we'd like to take this opportunity, all the way from
America, to say happy Christmas to you our faithful,
beloved fans all over the world who have made our life
worth living. And over here I have Mr. Malcolm Evans who
through thick and thin would surely like to say a word
of greeting at this festive occasion.
(M): Merry Christmas children everywhere!
(?): At the first stroke, it will be ...
(R): ... Ringo Starr. Thank you!
"Good evening."
"Hello me dear. I didn't know you were coming."
"I'm not surprised."
"Well, I am! Certainly am!"
"I would have thought so myself."
"Well, if you ask me, I think it's insane."
"Occasionally."
"Yes, me, too. Twice a week sometimes."
"Fourteen and six."
"Nineteen and five to save me if you don't mind."
"Yes, I know."
"Don't you say yes to me! I'm telling you!"
"This is a private line, you know."
"Private line? I've been on this line for two years." 



(R): Well, it's my proud pleasure tonight to introduce one of
the most versatile performers in our career. And he's
come all the way from Stokely Carmichel's -on-Sea.
And I hope you're going to like him. Let's give him a
big hand ...
(P): (Singing)
Happy New Year, happy Christmas,
Happy Easter, happy autumn,
Happy Michelmas, ev'rybody,
Happy Christmas, ev'rybody to you.
(J): Once upon a pool table there lived a short-haired
butcher's boy by the way of Ostergrad. It comes in
scented cesspool or be careful. Her father was in a
long story cut short in the middle of his life sentence.
We're indebted to the colloquial office for its immediate
disposal of her honorwitz, including, I might add, half a
fell of her twotem (*hoc virtallo a totem?). On the other handbag, I mean to say
l'amoure ne soome tu joure realistic, strictly speaking.
For this film is about an hourgla** houseboat. The full
meaning of Winchester Cathedral defies description. Their
loss was our Gainsborough nil.
(J (Double Tracked)):
The sound of a manservantile defectively lasting barred
up in a love-dizzy gar-di-dell time. How close can you
Gettysburg and ever underly council ya originally a
birdbath feeling?
(G): Cut!
We have a special guest here this evening, Mr.
Tiny Tim. I'd like to ask him to say a few words.
(T): Oh, hello to you nice Beatles. Ah, it's so wonderful,
what a thrill it is talking here. Ah, in Mr. Harrison's
presence, Mr. Weiss' presence, and all his nice wonderful
friends. And the thing is, I just wanna say Merry
Christmas to you all. And, ah, a Happy New Year.
(G): Thank you, Tiny. Would you like to sing us a little song?
(T): Ah, I'd love to. Here's a song I did in 1966 in front of
Miss Jill for the first time. And I did this in Albert
Hall, and what a thrill it was, ah, to do this then, and
now ... exactly the way I did it then.
(Singing)
He's a, ooh, real nowhere man,
Living in his nowhere land,
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody.
Hasn't got a point of view,
Knows not where he's going to,
Isn't he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere man, (yes?) Don't worry,
Take your time, don't hurry,
Nowhere man, the world's at your command, ooh.
He's a, huh huh, real nowhere man,
Living in his nowhere land,
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody, ooh, ooh.
(G): Thank you, Tiny. Thank you and God bless you, Tiny.
(T): God bless you all. Oh, God bless you all.
Ho!
Good King Wenceslas looked out
On the feast of Stephen (Hoo!)
As the slow ray round about
Deep and crisp and crispy
Brightly show the boot last night
On the mosty cruel
Henry Hall and David Lloyd
Betty Grable too-oo-oo
Hello, this is John, speaking with his voice. (Huh!)
We're all very happy to be able to talk to you like this on this little bit of plastic. This record reaches you at the end of a really gear year for us, and it's all due to you. When we made our first record on Parlophone towards the end of 1962, we hoped everybody would like what had already been our type of music for several years already. But we had no idea of all the gear things in store for us. It all happened really when Please Please Me became a number one hit and after that, well cor' the blimeys, heave the mo'! Our biggest thrill of the year, well, I suppose it must have been topping the bill at the London Palladium and then, only a couple of days later, being invited to take part in The Royal Variety Show. This time last year, we were all dead chuffed because "Love Me Do" got into the top twenty, and we can't believe really that so many things have happened in between already! Just before I pa** you over to Paul, (Arf-arf! Arf-arf!) I'd like to say thank you to all the Beatle people who have written to me during the year and everyone who sent gifts and cards for my birthday, which I'm trying to forget, in October. (Huh!) I'd like to reply personally to everyone, but I just haven't enough pens. In the meantime:
Garry Crimble to you
Garry Mimble to you
Getty Bable, dear Christmas
Happy Birthday me too
This is Paul here.
Everything that John said goes for me too, 'specially the bit about birthday cards and the parcels, 'cause all our homes and offices got stacks of mail last June, ow! Ha! Ha! When it was my birthday. Anyway, we're all dead pleased by the way you've treated us in 1963, and we'll try to do everything we can to please you with the type of songs we write and record next year. Oh yeah, somebody asked us if we still like jelly babies. Well! We used to like them, in fact we loved them and said so in one of the papers, you see. Ever since then, we've been getting them in boxes, packets and crates. Anyway, we've gone right off jelly babies, you see, but we still like peppermint creams and chocolate drops and dolly mixtures and all that sort of thing. (Yes! Yes! Oh yes!)
Well, lots of people asked us what we enjoy best, you see, concerts and television or recording? We like doing stage shows 'cause it's, you know, it's great to hear an audience enjoying themselves. But the thing we like best, I think so anyway, is going into the recording studio (yes, we enjoy that very kindly) to make new records, which is what we've been doing all day before we started on this special message. Well, eh, what we like to hear most is one of our songs, you know, taking shape in a recording studio, ah, one of the ones what John and I have written, and then listening to the tapes afterwards to hear how it all worked out, you see. Well, I'm running over my time, and people are telling me to stop, (Stop! Stop!) and Ringo, (Stop! Stop! Shouting those animals!) so I'll finish off now with it wishing everyone Happy Crimble and a Merry New Year and especially all the ones who paid the subscription. 



Ja, das wird uns danke schon
Und denn gruss von even
Ja, denn gruss von even schon
Ja, das wird wunderschon, boy
Danke schon
Ja, Ringo!
Hello, Ringo here.
As you know I was the last member to join The Beatles. I started to play drums in the group 1962, ha-ha-ha! Have been in a couple of other groups... (Oh, just wish the people a merry, happy, go on, for Christmas, Christmas) Merry, Happy New Year, and folks, Happy Christmas and may, may everything you wish be granted.
(Sing, sing us Wenceslas, King Wenceslas)
King Wenceslas:
Well, good King Wenceslas looked out (Oh ho!)
On the feast of Stephen (Hey!)
When the snow was on the ground (Yeah!)
Deep and crisp and even (Oh yeah!)
Hooray!
Thank you, Ringo! Thank you, Ringo! We'll phone you! (Ha ha ha!)
I'm George Harrison. Nobody else has said anything yet about our fan club secretaries, Ann Collingham and Bettina Rose, not to mention Freda Kelly in Liverpool. (Good old Freda!) So on behalf of us all, I'd just like to say a great, big thank you to Ann, Bettina and Freda for all the hard work they've done, and we just hope you can go on pleasing you for a long time, 'cause it's gonna, 'cause it to your reaction are to our records that really matters.
And I'd just like to say:
Brightly was the shone that night
Though the winter cruel
When a pork pie came inside
Gathering winter cruel
Rudolph, the red nosed reindeer (Ho!)
Had a very shiny nose (A shiny nose!)
When ev'rybody picked it...
Ha, ha, ha, ha...
Oh yeah! Oh!
Rudolph, the red nosed Ringo (Rudolph!)
Had a very shiny nose

All de children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you k**, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you k**, Bungalow Bill?
Deep in the jungle, where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes
All de children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you k**, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you k**, Bungalow Bill? 



The children asked him if to k** was not a sin
"Not when he looked so fierce", his mommy bu*ted in
"If looks could k**, it would have been us instead of him"
All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you k**, Bungalow Bill?

Day after day, alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
Well on the way, head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round 



And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
Ohh oh-oh-oh-oh ohh-oh-oh
Round and round and round and round and round
He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fool
They don't like him
The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
Ohhhh
Round and round and round and round and
Ohhhh

They can see that he's just a fool,
And he never gives an answer,
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.
Well on his way his head in a cloud,



The man of a thousand voices talking percetly loud
But nobody ever hears him,
Or the sound he appears to make,
And he never seems to notice,
But the fool on the hill . . .
Nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do.

All you need to do is say this little word
I know it sounds absurd but it's true
The magic in the mantra will give you the answer
And swallow this that's all you gotta do
Everything you need is here
And everything that's not here is not there
And if if there's something missing in this God almighty plan
Could it be you need a woman?
All you need to do is say this little word
I know it sounds absurd but it's true
The magic in the mantra will give you the answer
Just swallow this that's all you gotta do
Everything you need is here



But everything that's not here is not there
And if there's something missing in this God almighty plan
Could it be you need a woman?
Well all you need to do is say this little word
I know it sounds absurd but it's true
The magic in the mantra will give you the answer
And swallow this that's all you gotta do
Take three times a day after every meal
All you need to do is say this little word
I know it sounds absurd but it's true
The magic in the mantra will give you the answer
And swallow this that's all you gotta do

Like today lay before us.
I've got the sun in my heart
And my heart's in the sun.
Skies are as bright
As your eyes,
The horizon is open.
Love is the ceiling,
Feelings are reelings
Free as the air.
Forever on and forever,
Forever on side by side.
Who ever knew that we two



Could be free as we'd fancy,
Fancy is free
But are we bound
To each other by love,
To each other by love?
Who ever knew that we two
Could be free as we'd fancy,
Fancy is free
But are we bound
To each other by love,
To each other by love,
To each other by love,
To each other by love?

Without going out of my door
I can know all things of earth
Without looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven
The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows
Without going out of your door
You can know all things on earth



Without looking out of your window
You could know the ways of heaven
The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows
Arrive without traveling
See all without looking
Do all without doing
Without going out of my door
I can know all things of earth
Without looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven
The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows
Without going out of my door
You can know all things of earth



With out looking out of my window
You could know the ways of heaven
The farther one travels

In the beginning i misunderstood
But now i've got it, the word is good
Spread the word and you'll be free
Spread the word and be like be
Spread the work i'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love
Every where i go i hear it said
In the good and bad books that i have read



Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
It's the word i'm thinking of
And the only word is love
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love
Now that i know what i feel must be right
I'm here to show everybody the light
Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word i'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love

There are places I remember all my life
Though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
Of lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I loved them all
And with all these friends and lovers



There is no one compares with you
And these mem'ries lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
And I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I loved you more
There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time
When I'm alone
I think of you
And things you do
Go 'round my head
The things you said
Like "I love only you"
In my mind there's no sorrow 



Don't you know that it's so?
There'll be no sad tomorrow
Don't you know that it's so?
There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time
When I'm alone
There's a place
There is a place,
Where i can go,
When i feel low,
When i feel blue.
And it's my mind,
And there's no time when i'm alone.
I think of you,
And things you do,
Go 'round my head,
The things you said,
Like "i love only you."
In my mind there's no sorrow,



Don't you know that it's so.
There'll be no sad tomorrow,
Don't you know that it's so.
There is a place,
Where i can go,
When i feel low,
When i feel blue.
And it's my mind,
And there's no time when i'm alone.
There's a place...

You say you will love me
If I have to go
You'll be thinking of me
Somehow I will know
Someday when I'm lonely
Wishing you weren't so far away
Then I will remember
Things we said today
You say you'll be mine, girl
Till the end of time

Seems so hard to find

Deep in love, not a lot to say

I've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you have in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up
You're gonna cause more misery
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself 



'Cause I won't be there with you
Although your mind's opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify
All the things that you should
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
I've got a word or two

There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
Till there was you
There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
Till there was you
Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me
In sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew
There was love all around

Turn off your mind
Relax and float down stream
It is not dying
It is not dying
Lay down all thought
Surrender to the void
It is shining
It is shining
That you may see
The meaning of within
It is being
It is being
That love is all
And love is everyone
It is knowing 



It is knowing
That ignorance and hate
May mourn the dead
It is believing
It is believing
But listen to the
Colour of your dreams
It is not living
It is not living
Or play the game
Existence to the end
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Turn off your mind, relax and float down stream,
It is not dying, it is not dying
Lay down al thoughts, surrender to the void,
It is shining, it is shining.
Yet you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being
Love is all and love is everyone



It is knowing, it is knowing
And ignorance and hate mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing
But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not leaving, it is not leaving
So play the game "existence" to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning

Running to and fro, hard
Working at the mail
Never fail

Two of us riding nowhere
Spending someone's
Hard earned pay
Two of us Sunday driving
Not arriving
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home
Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches
On our way back home
We're on our way home



We're on our way home
We're going home
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead
Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing so low
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home
Two of us riding nowhere
Spending someone's
Hard earned pay
Two of us sunday driving
Not arriving
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home
Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home
You and i have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead
Two of us wearing raincoats



Standing so low
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home
You and i have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead
Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing so low
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home
We're going home
Better believe it

It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh how I've been alone
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried
But if your heart breaks
Don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong
Hold on, I won't delay
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried
I feel as though
You ought to know
That I've been good
As good as I can be
And if you do
I'll trust in you
And know that you
Will wait for me
It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home



I've been away now
Oh how I've been alone
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

And if you do
I'll trust in you

Will wait for me

And if your heart's strong
Hold on, I won't delay
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried
It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh, how I've been alone
It's been a long time
Now i'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh how i've been alone
Wait till i come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

Standing in the garden waiting for the sun to shine
Hand me my umbrella when she says she wish she was mine
Everybody does think a thing it didn't come
Instead of watching rainbows I'm gonna make me some
Instead of watching rainbows I'm gonna make me some
Standing in the garden waiting for the English sun to come and make me brown so I can be someone
Looking at the bench of next door neighbors
Crying to my mom of diamond tooth sabers



Everybody's got to have something hard to hold
Well instead of watching rainbows under the sun
You gotta get out son and make you one
You gotta get out son and make you one
Because you're not gonna make it if you cry cry cry I know
Shoot big
Shoot big
Whatever you do you gotta k** somebody to get what you wanna get
You gotta shoot big
You gotta shoot big
Until you shoot big
I can't stand it
Try to see it my way
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?
While you see it your way
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone
We can work it out
We can work it out
Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
Think of what I'm saying
We can work it out and get it straight or say good night
We can work it out
We can work it out
Life is very short and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again 



Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long
We can work it out
We can work it out
Life is very short and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again

I've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up
You're gonna cause more misery
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Although your mind's opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify
All the things that you should
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself

What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind
The other day I saw you
As I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you
I could feel my future fold
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why

It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?
I used to think of no on else
But you were just the same
You didn't even think of me
As someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die

We are traveling in the footsteps
Of those who've gone before
But we'll all be reunited (but if we stand reunited)
On a new and sunlit shore (then a new world is in store)
Oh when the saints go marching in
When the saints go marching in
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in
And when the sun refuse (begins) to shine
And when the sun refuse (begins) to shine
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in
When the moon turns red with blood
When the moon turns red with blood
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in
On that hallelujah day
On that hallelujah day
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in
Oh when the trumpet sounds the call
Oh when the trumpet sounds the call
Oh lord I want to be in that number



When the saints go marching in
Some say this world of trouble
Is the only one we need
But I'm waiting for that morning
When the new world is revealed
When the revelation (revolution) comes
When the revelation (revolution) comes
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in
When the rich go out and work
When the rich go out and work
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in
When the air is pure and clean
When the air is pure and clean
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in
When we all have food to eat
When we all have food to eat
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in
When our leaders learn to cry

[Verse 1]
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps
[Verse 2]
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you
[Verse 3]
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning



Still my guitar gently weeps
[Verse 4]
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you
[Verse 5]
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, ooh
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and i see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know why nobody told you how to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you.
I look at the world and i notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps



With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you.
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all...
Still my guitar gently weeps.

In progress...
Why why can't we love again?
Why why are you shy on love?
If you only knew how much I love you
Why can't you love me again?
Why why don't you open your heart?
Why why are we so far apart?
If you only knew how much I love you
Why can't you love me again?
I just want your loving arms around me, yeah
I got to find a way to make you take me back
Baby won't you tell me
Why why why why are we so far apart?

Why can't you love me
Why can't you love me
Why can't you love me again?
I love you, 'cause you tell me things I want to know.
And it's true that it really only goes to show,
That I know,
That I, I, I, I should never, never, never be blue.
Now you're mine, my happiness still makes me cry.
And in time, you'll understand the reason why,
If I cry,
It's not because I'm sad, but you're the only love that I've ever had.
I can't believe it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more misery.
Ask me why, I'll say I love you,



And I'm always thinking of you.
I love you, 'cause you tell me things I want to know.

Why why don't you open your heart?
Why why are we so far apart?
If you only knew how much i love you,
Why can't you love me again?
I just want your loving arms around me, yeah,
I got to find a way to make you take me back.
Baby won't you tell me
Why why why why are we so far apart?

We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth
Then it's far too late
When they pa** away
We were talking about the love we all could share when we find it
To try our best to hold it there
With our love
With our love we could save the world
If they only knew
Try to realise it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change 



And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you
We were talking about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know
They can't see
Are you one of them?
When you've seen beyond yourself
Then you may find peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see
We're all one and life flows on within you and without you
We were talking-about the space between us all
And the people-who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth-then it's far too late-when they pa** away.

We're all one, and life flows on within you and without you.

Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying
We were talking
About the space between us all
And the people
Who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth

When they pa** away

In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found a sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
Full steam ahead, Mr. Boatswain, full steam ahead



Full steam ahead it is, Sergeant
Cut the cable! Drop the cable!
Aye-aye, sir, aye-aye
Captain, captain
As we live a life of ease
Every one of us (every one of us) has all we need (has all we need)
Sky of blue (sky of blue) and sea of green (sea of green)

We all live in a yellow submarine
A yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine

PROLOGUE
NARRATOR
Once upon a time, or maybe twice, there was an unearthly paradise called
Pepperland. Eighty thousand leagues beneath the sea it lay... or lie, I'm not too sure.
00:01:49 THE BLUE MEANIES OVERLOOK PEPPERLAND
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Pepperland is a tickle of joy on the blue belly of the universe. It must be scratched.
Right, Max?
MAX
Yes, Your Blueness.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
What?! We Meanies only take NO for an answer. Is that understood, Max?
MAX
No, Your Blueness.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
That's better. Are the troops in readiness?
MAX
No, Your Blueness.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
The Bonkers?
MAX
No.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Clowns?
MAX
No.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Snapping Turks?
Page 2
MAX
No.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Anti-music missiles?
MAX
No.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
The dreadful Flying Glove?
MAX
No.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Splendid! Today, Pepperland goes blooey! Fire!
The first blue bubble encloses the stand where the band plays. Everybody runs
scared.
FRED
The Meanies are coming! The Meanies are coming!
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Glove, Glove, come here, Glove! Look out there, and what do you see? Tell him,
Max.
MAX
Someone running, Glove.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Yes. Well, you'll soon put a stop to that, won't you, Glovey? Go, Glove, point! And
having pointed, pounce down! I haven't laughed so much since Pompeii! What?!
What?! What?! The Glove is losing his touch. Do your worst! Explode them!
FRED, to the Glove, which is pointed him
It's not polite to point!
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Thing of beauty... Destroy it for ever!
Fred to the Mayor and other three people who are playing music.
FRED
Sir, Sir, the Meanies are coming!
MAYOR
Not here, Young Fred. They wouldn't dare.
FRED
They would. They are. What are you going to do?
Page 3
MAYOR
Finish the quartet.
BLUE MEANIES
Fire!
One bomb gets one musician.
FRED
Trio, sir.
Another bomb gets another musician.
FRED
Duet, sir.
MAYOR
Duet?
The third musician is reached too.
FRED
Solo!
MAYOR
Young Fred, the Blue Meanies are coming!
Fred takes the Mayor in his arms and runs.
MAYOR
4 scores and 32 bars ago our forefathers...
FRED
Our quartet?
MAYOR
And foremothers...
FRED
Another quartet?
MAYOR
Made it in this yellow submarine...
FRED
What, that little thing?
MAYOR
To Pepperland. Climb aboard, Young Fred.
FRED
Page 4
But, sir, I can't even make my soap float.
MAYOR
I'm appointing you Lord Admiral.
FRED
Lord Admiral? In that event, yes.
MAYOR
Hurry, Young Fred. Go! Get help!
FRED
Where should I go?
MAYOR
No time for trivialities.
As the Blue Meanies bomb the Mayor, Fred sails.

0:10:20 THE YELLOW SUBMARINE GETS TO LIVERPOOL
0:11:03 THE BEATLES: ELEANOR RIGBY
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people,
where do they all belong?
Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no-one will hear
No-one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?
All the lonely people,
where do they all come from?
All the lonely people,
where do they all belong?
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No-one was saved
All the lonely people,
where do they all come from?
All the lonely people,
where do they all belong?
Page 6
0:13:14 STREET OF LIVERPOOL
RINGO
Who... is me? Liverpool can be a lonely place on a Saturday night. And this is only
Thursday morning. Compared with my life, Eleanor Rigby's was a gay, mad whirl.
Nothing ever happens to me. I feel like an old, splintered drumstick. I'd jump into the
River Mersey, but it looks like rain. Nothing ever happens to me.
As Ringo walks down Hope Street, is followed by the submarine. A bobby lies on the
floor playing with a cat.
BOBBY
Puss, puss-puss. Puss, puss, puss. Here, p**y. Here, p**y, p**y, p**y.
Here, p**y, p**y. [The Bobby sees Ringo] Ahem, er...
RINGO
Would you believe me if I told you I was being followed by a yellow submarine?
BOBBY
No, I would not.
RINGO
Oh yeah, I didn't think you would.
Ringo goes up a hill to reach The Pier, the house when he lives with the other
Beatles.
RINGO
I could have sworn there was a yellow submarine. But that isn't logical, is it? It must
have been one of them unidentified flying cupcakes or a figment of my imagination.
But I don't have an imagination.
Ringo enters the house. Fred comes and knocks at the door.
FRED
Help, help, help!
RINGO, from inside
Thanks, I don't need any.
FRED
Help! Won't you please, please help me?
RINGO
Be specific.
FRED
... music ... submarine ... Blue Meanies!!!
RINGO
What you need is...
Page 7
FRED
'H' for hurry, 'E' for ergent, 'L' for love me and 'P' for p-p-p-p-please help.
0:16:08 THE HOUSE OF THE BEATLES
Door opens and Fred enters. There is a long corridor with many doors. A lot of
stranges things enter and leave the rooms.
VOZ
Hiya, baby!
Ringo goes downstairs in a car.
RINGO
Your story has touched my heart. Jump in, we'll get my friends.
FRED
Bless you!
RINGO
Did I sneeze?
They return to the corridor.
FRED
Just park it here.
RINGO
I'll just park it here.
They enter through a door.
FRED
What would your friends be doing here?
RINGO
Displaying.
FRED
Displaying what?
RINGO
Displaying around.
The room is full of interesting objects, like a museum.
FRED
Can't we take one of these?
RINGO
No, Fred, I only work with me mates.
Page 8
FRED
Frankenstein?
RINGO
I used to go out with his sister.
FRED
His sister?
RINGO
Yeah. Phyllis. Hey, I wonder what would happen if I pulled this lever.
FRED
You mustn't do that.
RINGO
Can't help it. I'm a born lever-puller.
He does it. Frankenstein gets up and takes a drink. Then he becomes John.
JOHN
Ringo, I've just had the strangest dream.
RINGO
I warned you not to eat on an empty stomach. Now listen to Old Fred.
FRED
... music ... submarine ... Blue Meanies!!!
RINGO
What do you think?
JOHN
I think he needs a rehearsal.
They return to the hall.
JOHN
When do we leave?
RINGO
Let's get the other two, John.
JOHN
What day is it?
RINGO
Sitar-day.
JOHN
Then George will be here.
Page 9
He opens a door. Indian images.
0:18:55 THE BEATLES: LOVE YOU TO (beginning)
RINGO
George, what are you doing up there?
GEORGE, driving a red car
Now, what is it, Ringo? Is there a matter you'd like to take up or down?
RINGO, pointing Old Fred
This chap here...
FRED, John and Ringo also say the last words
...Blue Meanies!!!
GEORGE
You're nuts, the pair of you.
RINGO
Wait a minute, that's my car.
GEORGE
How do you know it's your car?
RINGO
I'd know it anywhere.
GEORGE
What's it look like, then?
RINGO
It's red with yellow wheels. (The car changes colours) I mean, blue with orange
wheels.
GEORGE
It's all in the mind.
All they get into the car.
RINGO
Come on, move over, I'm driving.
GEORGE
I got here first.
They argue about who will drive.
RINGO/GEORGE
I'll drive, if you like... No, you sit in the middle... I'm sitting in the middle... You said
you were driving... I am driving... I'll get in the back, then.
Page 10
Finally, they departed. A car crash is heard. They return and open a door. Inside the
room there is a girl lying on a bed. King-Kong looks through the window and grabs
the girl.
JOHN
Do you think we're interrupting something?
RINGO
I think so. We'd better find Paul, hadn't we?
John opens another door. A train is coming at full speed. John closes scared.
GEORGE
It's all in the mind.
JOHN
Try one of those doors.
Ringo does it. Inside the room there is a loud party.
GEORGE
Yes, they do look very nice, don't they?
RINGO
Yes, they do.
JOHN
They do, though, don't they?
GEORGE
Yes, they do.
RINGO
Don't dey, dough?
GEORGE
Dough?
Paul meets them.
JOHN
Don't ask. Dat's dough.
PAUL
What's the matter, folks?
RINGO
Blue Meanies.
FRED
Well, lads, what do you think?
Page 11
JOHN, as they walk
I think that...
FRED
Remember, there'll be rough seas ahead. So, what do you think?
PAUL
Well, then, um...
FRED
Pounding, overwhelming waves. What do you think of that?
JOHN
Well, I think that...
RINGO
As a matter of fact, I...
BEATLES
I think...
FRED
Well?
RINGO
I've forgotten.
They all go out and stop in front of the submarine.
FRED
Right, then, let's get this vessel shipshape.
JOHN
I kind of like the way it is, submarine shape.
0:22:18 THE JOURNEY BEGINS
We see a series of landscapes. We hear the end of “A day in the life”.
0:22:45 INSIDE THE SUBMARINE
PAUL
So, this is a submarine.
JOHN
Soft, isn't it?
RINGO
Not if you're on the bottom.
FRED
All right, lads, time to stow the gab and turn to.
Page 12
PAUL
Groovy. How do you start this thing?
FRED
It starts with a Blue Meanie attack.
JOHN
Supposing there's no Blue Meanies in the neighbourhood?
FRED
Then you start looking for a switch.
RINGO
Perhaps this is it.
The submarine sails in a strange world.
0:23:22 THE BEATLES: ALL TOGETHER NOW
One, two, three, four / Can I have a little more?
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten / I love you
A, B, C, D / Can I bring my friend to tea?
E, F, G, H, I, J / I love you
Sail the ship
Chop the tree
Skip the rope
Look at me
All together now
All together now (all together now)…
Black, white, green, red / Can I take my friend to bed?
Pink, brown, yellow, orange and blue / I love you (All together now)
All together now (all together now),
all together now (all together now)...
Sail the ship
Chop the tree
Skip the rope
Look at me
All together now
All together now (all together now)…
0:25:30 THE SEA OF TIME
RINGO
What time is it?
Page 13
JOHN
It's time to time.
PAUL
Look, the hands are slowing down.
The submarine sails back.
PAUL
Do you ever get the feeling...
JOHN
Yeah.
PAUL
… that things aren't as rosy as they appear to be under the surface?
RINGO
What's happening, John?
JOHN
Well, in my humble opinion, we've become involved in Einstein's time-space
continuum theory.
GEORGE
All right.
JOHN
Relatively speaking, that is.
GEORGE
Of course. Maybe time's gone on strike.
RINGO
What for?
GEORGE
Shorter hours.
RINGO
I don't blame it. It must be very tiring being time, mustn't it?
JOHN & PAUL
Why?
RINGO
It's a twenty-four hour day, isn't it?
JOHN
You surprise me, Ringo.
RINGO
Page 14
Why?
JOHN
Dealing in abstracts.
RINGO
Just because I'm a drummer... I don't half feel funny.
Ringo shrinks.
PAUL, shrinking too
You're not half the lad you used to be.
GEORGE, same
Look, everything's getting bigger.
JOHN, same
It's not. It's us that are getting smaller...
RINGO, mourning
I want my mam.
FRED
And younger. There you are, lads. Old Fred will get you out of all this.
RINGO, pointed outside
Look at that!
GEORGE
It's all a load of Father Xmas's.
JOHN
It's not. It's Father Time.
GEORGE
How do you know?
JOHN
I read it in a book.
FRED
I don't want to alarm you, but the years are going backwards.
GEORGE
What's that mean, Old Fred?
FRED
It means if we slip back through time at this rate, very soon we'll all disappear up our
own existence.
JOHN
What are we gonna do, then?
Page 15
FRED
We could always try a few bu*tons.
RINGO, sobs
I want my mam.
FRED
Time's fast running out for us, I'm afraid!
JOHN
Can't we do something to the clock?
GEORGE
What do you mean, John?
JOHN
Move the hands forward, see what happens.
FRED
Clever lad.
John forces the clockwise and the submarine goes ahead.
JOHN
Something strange is happening. It's speeding up now.
PAUL, looking outside
Funny... a submarine remarkably like our own.
JOHN
Uncannily.
RINGO
There's someone in it. Look.
JOHN
And they're waving.
RINGO
It's a group of fellas.
JOHN
Wave back. Maybe we're both part of a vast yellow submarine fleet.
RINGO
There's only two of us.
JOHN
Then I would suggest that yonder yellow submarine is one of ourselves…
FRED
Page 16
Going backwards...
JOHN
… in time!
GEORGE
Look at Ringo.
Ringo is getting older, and so the rest.
JOHN
Oh dear, we're all the same.
PAUL
Senile delinquents.
GEORGE
And I can hear my beard growing.
RINGO
We'd better do something.
0:28:20 THE BEATLES: WHEN I'M SIXTY FOUR
When I get older, losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me,
will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
You'll be older, too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings, go for a ride
As Paul sings, time is going back and The Beatles turn back to their real age.
We can read a title: “sixty-four years is 33.661.440 minutes and one minute is a
long time… Let us demonstrate”.
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me,
will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
Page 17
A series of well illustrated numbers accompany the voice of Paul form 1 to 64,
matching the last one with the end of the song.
Every summer we can rent a cottage
in the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee,
Vera, Chuck and Dave
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely
what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form,
mine forever more
Will you still need me,
will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
JOHN
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, gentlemen, but would you agree that we have been
pa**ing through the Sea of Time?
RINGO
That would explain a few things. I'm glad I'm not young any more. Or was it old?
JOHN
What kind of a sea is this?
FRED
The Sea of Science.
JOHN
Oh, yeah.
0:31:15 THE BEATLES: A NORTHERN SONG
If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
He just wrote it like that
When you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are
They just play it like that
It doesn't really matter
What chords I play
What words I say
Or time of day it is
Cause it's only a Northern Song
Page 18
It doesn't really matter
What clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern Song
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct
There's nobody there
And I told you there's no-one there.
0:33:46 A MONSTER WITH A TRUNK AND TUSKS
As the song sounded The Beatles evolved through the space. When they come back
to the submarine a strange animal enters with them.
GEORGE
He looks wrong.
PAUL
He doesn't look at all well.
GEORGE
In fact, he's horrible.
JOHN, hiding himself
He's so ugly.
ALL
Really ugly!
The animal breaks to mourn.
FRED
Somebody push a bu*ton.
Ringo does and the animal is ejected outside the submarine to the Sea of Monsters.
0:34:18 SEA OF MONSTERS
JOHN
There's a Cyclops.
PAUL
Can't be. He's got two eyes.
JOHN
Then it must be a bi-Cyclops.
GEORGE
There's another one.
Page 19
JOHN
A whole cyclopedia.
Among the monsters there is one that swallows everything. The Beatles look out the
hatch.
JOHN
There's a school of whales.
RINGO
They look a bit old for school.
PAUL
University, then.
RINGO, drives the submarine
University of Whales. They look like dropouts to me.
FRED
You've got to steer clear!
RINGO
Steer clear?
FRED
Yes, steer. Clear?
RINGO
Yes, dear.
Ringo presses a bu*ton. The submarine shows a big smile. The whales smile too.
FRED
Now, whatever you do, don't touch that bu*ton.
RINGO
Which bu*ton?
FRED
That one.
RINGO,
This one?
Ringo presses the bu*ton and he is ejected from the submarine on the back of a
dinosaur. Before he is eaten he is rescued by a kind of horse.
FRED
That was the panic bu*ton.
PAUL
Page 20
Poor Ringo.
JOHN
Poor lad.
GEORGE
Never did no harm to no-one.
JOHN
Lads, now Ringo's gone, what are we gonna do?
FRED
Learn to sing trios.
PAUL
No, let's save the poor devil.
JOHN
I see footsteps.
FRED
It's a pair of kinky boot-beasts.
JOHN
Preparing to attack.
The boots tryes to step on the submarine. But Paul presses a bu*ton and the
submarine steps on the boots.
JOHN
I don't half miss Ringo.
PAUL
He's far out there.
JOHN
Always was.
RINGO
'H' is for hurry!
PAUL
Here comes Ringo!
Ringo rides horseback.
JOHN
There goes Ringo.
A Boxing monster approaches the submarine.
GEORGE
Page 21
It's seen us.
FRED
Find a boxing bu*ton.
PAUL
Whoever heard of a boxing bu*ton?
JOHN
Who cares? Find one.
The Boxing monster hits the submarine.
FRED, pushes a bu*ton
Fire one!
The submarine expels lot of stranges gadgets, including a banner with the words
“The Rolling Sto”.
FRED
Uh-oh, wrong one.
JOHN
That.
The submarine flatters the monsters with a cigar. We hear “Air on the G-string”, de
Bach until the cigar explodes.
GEORGE
There goes Ringo again.
JOHN
Rides well, doesn't he?
RINGO
'E' is for ergent...
The vacuum monster appears again.
FRED
Oh no, not the dreaded vacuum again.
PAUL
We'll be s**ed into oblivion.
GEORGE
Or even further.
FRED
Put her in reverse.
JOHN
Page 22
So long, s**er.
PAUL
Too much.
GEORGE
Too soon.
FRED
Reverse! Reverse!
JOHN
Ringo time.
Another monster is swallowed by the vacuum monster.
RINGO
'L' is for love me...
Indians go chasing Ringo.
JOHN
Indians!
RINGO
Help! Help! 'P' is for please...
JOHN
So, press a bu*ton.
0:39:33. The seventh cavalry leaves the submarine and rescues Ringo.
JOHN
How was it, Ringo?
RINGO
'Arrowing.
The vacuum monster keeps gobbling other monsters.
FRED
Look who's back. Full speed ahead.
RINGO
Oh, no.
JOHN
The motor's packing in.
FRED
By all the sea nymphs, we're losing power. We're being swallowed. What shall we
do?
Page 23
PAUL
Serve tea.
JOHN
Lovely.
The vacuum monster swallows everythig, even it self.
FRED
By Neptune's knickerbockers, she's puttered out.
JOHN
Maybe we should call a road service.
PAUL
Can't. No road.
RINGO
And we're not sub-scribers.
JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE
Subscribers! Oh!
GEORGE
I know something about motors. Let me have a look.
FRED
Here.
GEORGE
Is that the motor?
FRED
Can't you tell one when you see one?
GEORGE
Of course I can. Let me peruse it.
Put his finger on the motor and gets a shock.
JOHN
What do you think?
GEORGE
I think I burned my finger.
RINGO, looking outside
Here, lads. Look at this.
JOHN
What do you think it is?
Page 24
GEORGE
Nothing.
RINGO
Looks like nothing.
PAUL
It's a local inhabitant.
RINGO
He's probably one of the nothings.
PAUL
At least that's something. Let's show him our motor.
JOHN
Steady on. You don't want to show your motor to just anybody.
GEORGE
But this is a nobody.
JEREMY
Medic, pedic, zed oblique,
orphic, morphic, dorphic, Greek.
Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo.
So little time, so much to know.
JOHN
Can you tell us where we're at?
JEREMY
A true Socratic query, that.
JOHN
And who the Billy Shears are you?
JEREMY
Who? Who indeed am I?
He gives a different visiting card to anyone.
JOHN
Jeremy?
PAUL
Hillary?
GEORGE
b**b?
RINGO
Page 25
Ph. D?
ALL
Who?
JEREMY
Eminent physicist, polyglot cla**icist,
prize-winning botanist,
hard biting satirist,
talented pianist, good dentist, too.
JOHN
Lousy poet.
JEREMY
Critic's voice, take your choice.
RINGO
Must be one of them angry young men.
PAUL
Or a daffy old creep.
JEREMY
I, daffy old creep?
GEORGE
Do you speak English?
JEREMY
Old English, middle, a dialect, pure...
PAUL
Well, do you speak English?
JEREMY
You know, I'm not sure.
RINGO
He's so smart, he doesn't even remember what he knows.
PAUL
Why don't we show him our motor?
JOHN
Should we really... show him our motor?
PAUL
He may not have seen one before.
JEREMY
Turbo-prop, super-combustible spring.
Page 26
Metrocyclonic and stereophonic,
this motor, I see, has a broken down thing.
JOHN
He fixed it?
PAUL
He fixed it.
GEORGE
Great. Let's go.
JEREMY
I must complete my bust, two novels,
finish my blueprints, begin my beguine.
JOHN
Must you always talk in rhyme?
JEREMY
If I spoke prose, you'd all find out,
I don't know what I talk about.
Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo.
So little time, so much to know.
PAUL
Hey, fellas. Look.
JEREMY
The footnotes for my 19th book.
This is my standard procedure for doing it.
And while I compose it,
I'm also reviewing it.
GEORGE
A b**b for all seasons.
PAUL
How can he lose?
JOHN
Were your notices good?
JEREMY
It's my policy never to read my reviews.
JOHN
There must be a word for what he is.
0:43:00 THE BEATLES: NOWHERE MAN
He's a real Nowhere Man
Page 27
Sitting in his Nowhere Land
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody
Doesn't have a point of view,
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me
Nowhere Man, please listen,
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command
He's as blind as he can be,
Just sees what he wants to see



Nowhere Man, can you see me at all?
Nowhere Man, don't worry,
Take your time, don't hurry
Leave it all till somebody else
lends you a hand
Doesn't have a point of view,
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me
Nowhere Man, please listen,
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command
He's a real Nowhere Man,
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody
JOHN
Okay, men, all aboard. Let's go somewhere.
RINGO
What about him?
JOHN
He's happy enough going around in circles.
RINGO
Poor little fella.
PAUL
I don't know. Ringo's just a sentimentalist.
RINGO
Look at him. Can't he come with us? [Goes upto him]
Mr. b**b, you can come with us, if you like.
Page 28
JEREMY
You mean, you'd take a Nowhere Man?
RINGO
Come on, we'll take you somewhere.
Inside the submarine, John gives Fred the motor.
JOHN to Jeremy
Okay, b**by. Down the hatch.
JEREMY laughs
Down the hatch. A quite curious phrase.
The middle South Midlands
Victorian phase.
Its usage undoubtedly on the increase.
I must work it into
my New Statesman piece.
JOHN
That's the hatch, friend.
JEREMY
Indeed.
FRED
Steady now, crew. Prepare to go forward.
GEORGE
Forward.
PAUL
Forward.
JOHN
Forward.
RINGO
Forward.
ALL
Forward!
But the submarine has problems going forward.
JOHN
It's awfully quiet.
GEORGE
What shall we do, Jeremy?
JEREMY
Page 29
Repair, revive, revamp, renew.
Ipse dixit, just turn the screw.
[Ipse dixit = he said]
The Beatles and the Nowhere man go outside.
JEREMY
Log sign, clog sign, big thingamabob.
JOHN
What's he saying?
PAUL
What's he doing?
JEREMY
Chewing gum will do the job. A turn of the screw, and all is and all is new.
The submarine stars, but only Fred is on board.
FRED
I can't stop her. 'H' is for hurry, 'E' is for ergent, 'L' is for love me…
JOHN
'P' is for... goodbye?
GEORGE
That was lovely, Jeremy.
PAUL
We've lost the sub for good.
JOHN
Or for bad. Or for worse.
JEREMY
I'm sorry about that.
RINGO
But he did fix the motor.
PAUL
Where are we?
They stand on a head. There are a lot of heads around.
JOHN
It looks like the foothills.
PAUL
The foothills of what?
JOHN
Page 30
The foothills of the headlands.
0:48:06 THE BEATLES: LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees
and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you,
you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun
in her eyes and she's gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people
eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles
as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head
in the clouds and you're gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With Plasticine porters
with looking gla** ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Lucy in the sky with diamonds…
0:51:09 ON THE FOOTHILLS OF THE HEADLANDS
JOHN
Carry on, lads, carry on.
RINGO
Certainly was carrying on.
Page 31
JOHN
I feel a draft.
PAUL
We must be near the Sea of Holes. Don't you think we should ask somebody for
directions?
JOHN, talks to a ma** of heads
Excuse us...
PAUL
Can you tell us the way to Pepperland?
JOHN
Thanks.
PAUL
Gosh, look at all this dust? Where did it come from?
JEREMY
A chemical error and quite imprecise. This is a condiment...
RINGO
Condi...
JEREMY
A spice.
JOHN
He's right, you know. It's pepper.
PAUL
Pepper?
GEORGE
Pepper.
They smell and sneeze. The ma** of heads sneeze too. They fly into the Sea of
Holes.
0:52:08 THE SEA OF HOLES
RINGO
John? Paul? George? Is anybody home?
PAUL
Where are we?
JOHN
A holey sea. This place reminds me of Blackburn, Lancashire.
Page 32
PAUL
Oh, boy...
GEORGE
How many do you think there are in all?
JEREMY
Enough to fill the Albert Hall.
PAUL
Didn't Old Fred mention something about the Sea of Holes just before the Sea of
Green?
JOHN
Yeah.
GEORGE
Through one of them spots must be the Sea of Green. But which? Which one?
JEREMY
Thesis, antithesis, synthesis, causes of causal causation.
JOHN
Jeremy, what do you know about holes?
JEREMY
There are simply no holes in my education.
PAUL
You mean you haven't composed a whole book?
GEORGE
Great. What shall we do?
JEREMY
Be empirical. Look.
RINGO
The b**by's making more and more sense.
PAUL
It's getting better all the time.
JOHN
Great. Come on, let's all look for the Sea of Green. The Sea of Holes... into the Sea
of Green.
JEREMY
Hydrolate, verdant chrysodine.
I think we're near the Sea of Green.
Page 33
Jeremy Man is caught in a leg by a Blue Meanie. Ringo picks a hole up and plays for
a while before to put it in his pocket.
RINGO
I've got a hole in me pocket.
PAUL
Where's Jeremy?
JOHN
He was over there.
GEORGE
He's not here now.
PAUL
He must have jumped ship, then.
RINGO
He wouldn't do that. He's our friend. b**by, Jeremy, Hillary, where are you?
0:54:29 Suddenly, everything is tinted of green as we hear a bit part of the song
Yellow submarine: “Sea of green, sea of green, sea of green, green, green, green...”
The Beatles arrive to Pepperland, just on the base of the temple.
0:54:41 PEPPERLAND
JOHN
Pepperland. A bit salty around the edges. Looks all dingy.
GEORGE
And drab.
PAUL
And quiet.
Ringo finds a pile of apples. Take one and pa**es it to Paul.
JOHN
Safe at last.
PAUL
And none the worse for our adventures.
JOHN
Reminiscent in many ways of the late Mr. Ulysses.
RINGO
There's an eye in the apples.
Page 34
Ringo brings down the apples and uncover the Mayor. The Yellow submarine comes
down from the sky and lands on the house of music. Fred descends sitting down in
an anchor.
FRED
There she blows! Lord Mayor, sir... I've made it, I'm back.
GEORGE
Who's this?
FRED
Our Lord Mayor. He's been bonked. [Ringo removes the apples]. Lord Mayor, sir...
unbonk yourself. Even a little snatch of a tune might get him up again.
JOHN
All right, let's sing.
0:55:54 THE BEATLES: HAVE YOU GOT TIME TO RECTIFY
Have you got time to rectify, time to rectify...
MAYOR
Do I hear music? Do I see... Young Fred?
FRED
You do, Lord Mayor.
MAYOR
Bless my metronome. And did you bring the help?
FRED
Yes, yes. Look.
MAYOR
Holy pizzicato, Young Fred. It's quite uncanny, your faces...
PAUL
We're quite cute, really.
MAYOR
You could pa** for the originals.
JOHN
We are the originals.
They go downstairs from the house of music.
MAYOR
No, no... Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
RINGO
They couldn't be much with a name like that. Sergeant Pepper?
Page 35
FRED
You could impersonate them and rally the land to rebellion.
MAYOR
Where are your instruments?
JOHN
Lost in the Monstrous Sea.
PAUL
Sea of Monsters.
FRED
We'll get other instruments, Lord Mayor.
MAYOR
Not a chance. The Meanies captured everything that maketh music.
PAUL
They hate music that much, do they?
MAYOR
They shrink at the very sound.
JOHN
Okay, you guys. It's shrinking time in Pepperland.
All people in Pepperland keeps grey and motionless (except for escape from the blue
meanies).
BLUE MEANIE
Aim, fire!
The Beatles hide behind cut-outs.
PAUL
He reminds me of my old English teacher.
JOHN
Look, if you must shout, shout quietly.
GEORGE
What do we do?
JOHN
Coagulate with the crowd.
PAUL
Cut-outs at the ready.
JOHN
Page 36
Then let's cut out.
They come to a high bandstand surrounded by thorns.
PAUL
What a grand bandstand.
JOHN
That's where the gear's kept. Come on.
Blue meanies with dogs.
GEORGE
Cavey, cavey.
At dusk.
PAUL
All right, the coast is clear.
GEORGE
Now's our chance.
RINGO
But how'll we get over?
GEORGE
Easy. Follow me.
They jump the fence of thorns
BLUE MEANIE
A-ha! You fools!
The watch fires his machine gun.
The Beatles reach the bandstand moving between asleep blue meanies.
RINGO
It's not very light in here, is it?
GEORGE
Shh! Keep the noise down.
JOHN
Look what I found. It's their uniforms.
PAUL
Nice bit of gear, that.
RINGO
They'll look great on, eh?
Page 37
PAUL
Dey will, won't dey?
RINGO
Won't dey, dough.
JOHN
How do I look?
PAUL
Groovy, groovy. How about me?
RINGO, looking thru the window
Bad scene, lads. We're surrounded.
GEORGE
Oh, heck.
RINGO
A million billion Meanies.
PAUL
They're coming this way.
ALL
Hide!
Trying to hide they make a lot of noise.
PAUL
Do you think they heard us?
JOHN
I hope not.
GEORGE
What did you say?
SOMEONE
Shhhh!
GEORGE
Good plan.
1:03:22 DAWN, by Grieg.
PAUL
Look. They're all asleep.
RINGO
They look cute when they're asleep. Almost human.
Page 38
GEORGE
Come on. Let's get out of here.
PAUL
On tiptoe.
They take their instruments and go down the hill.
RINGO
Tiptoe through the Meanies...
THE OTHER
Shh!
Ringo steps on the bagpipe. Some meanies wake.
PAUL
Let's exude.
The Beatles are persecuted. Ringo falls down and jumps on the John arms.
GEORGE
Relax, lads. Not a Meanie in sight.
JOHN
Not even a teeny Meanie.
PAUL
Not even a teeny-weeny Meanie.
RINGO
Great.
PAUL
Oh, look. Breakfast.
RINGO
I'm dying for a bit of brekky.
George takes an apple. Four tall meanies do the same.
JOHN
Look out.
A blue meanie heads the four tall meanies.
CHIEF
Sound off, one, two, three, four...
TALL MEANIES
One, two, three, four...
Page 39
The Beatles, one above the other, march behind the row of tall meanies.
JOHN
Five.
CHIEF
Five? [John eliminates the last one with an apple stroke.] Sound off, one, two, three,
four.
TALL MEANIES
One, two, three...
JOHN
Four.
John eliminates another one.
TALL MEANIES
One, two...
JOHN
Three.
CHIEF
Three?
JOHN
Two.
CHIEF
Two?
JOHN
One.
CHIEF
One? [The chief stares at the column made of the four Beatles] Are you Bluish? You
don't look Bluish.
JOHN
Run for it.
The Beatles escape again.
PAUL
Right, men. We've made it.
GEORGE
Instruments at the ready.
JOHN
Okay, on the beat. A-one, a-two, a-three, a-four, a-five, a-six…
Page 40
RINGO
Hey, can't you make it three?
JOHN
All right. On the beat of three... A-one, a-two, a-three...
1:06:34 THE BEATLES: SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND
It was twenty years ago today,
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style,
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile
So may I introduce to you,
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sit back and let the evening go
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely,
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
It's wonderful to be here,
it's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience,
we'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home
I don't really wanna stop the show,
But I thought you might like to know
That the singer's gonna sing a song,
And he wants you all to sing along
So let me introduce to you,
The one and only Billy Shears
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Billy Shears!
What would you think if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key
The inhabitants of Pepperland recover color and smile. Lennon has been presented
as Billy Shears, but Ringo's voice is heard.
01:08:49 THE MEANIES GATHER AROUND THEIR CHIEF
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Page 41
Ah! The hills are alive...
ASSISTANT
With the sound of music.
The Chief Blue Meanie hits his a**istant. Then he gets a tantrum.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Who is responsible for this?
ASSISTANT
Rimsky Korsakov?
The a**istant is shot and kicking, but still resurfaces.
ASSISTANT
Guy Lombardo?
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE, laughs
My dear friend... let us not forget that heaven is blue. [Suddenly choleric] Tomorrow,
the world! Bring in my Bluebird.
PEPPERLAND INHABITANTS
Who? Who? Who?
PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO
Who? Who? Who?
The mouth of John expels the question WHO?
A blue big glove crosses the air.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Ah! Here you are, my little Glovey-dovey. Go get thee hence and destroy yon
upstarts. [New rage] Smash them! Squash them! Crash them! Oblue-terate them!
MEDICAL DOCTOR, as the Chief collapses
Here, your Blueness, have some nasty medicine.
CHIEF, exuberant
The Glove, the Glove, the Glove!
PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO
Glove? Glove? Glove?
From the mouth of John emerge the word GLOVE.
GEORGE
He's a clever lad, isn't he?
RINGO
Open your mouth, it won't hurt. [Try to see into the mouth of John] John, you haven't
half got a big mouth, haven't you?
Page 42
GEORGE
It's easy. All you need is love.
JOHN
Yes.
And expeles again the word GLOVE, but this time the initial G vanishes.
1:12:02 THE BEATLES : ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE
Love, love, love (x3)
There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love,
Love is all you need
Nothing you can know that isn't known,
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
There's nowhere you can be
that isn't where you're meant to be
It's easy
All you need is love, (All together now)
All you need is love, (Everybody)
All you need is love, love,
Love is all you need
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
The words emerged from the mouth of John neutralize the glove attacks.
JOHN
Go, Glove, lovely Glove.
RINGO
You took the words right out of my mouth, John.
GEORGE
Hey, wait, and watch. [Floating] It's all in the mind, you know.
Love is all you need
Love is all you need
Page 43
Everything revives in Pepperland. The word NO becomes NOW and then KNOW.
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
The meanies flee and The Beatles are acclaimed by the crowd.
A little bit further they find a blue gla** ball.
GEORGE
Hey, that's a funny place to leave a goldfish bowl.
JOHN
In Pepperland all things are possible.
PAUL
It's not a goldfish bowl.
RINGO
Just a big gla** bowl, then.
PAUL
Yes, blue gla**.
RINGO
It must be from Kentucky.
Paul knocks the bowl. Some music starts to sound.
JOHN
There's something inside.
RINGO
Four fellas.
GEORGE
What are they doing there?
PAUL
They're not having a ball, that's for sure.
JOHN
It can't be.
PAUL
It's us.
JOHN
But we're here.
PAUL
It's Sgt. Pepper's...
RINGO
Page 44
Lonely...
GEORGE
Hearts Club...
GEORGE
Band.
JOHN
The resemblance is truly striking. If I could come in here I think the theory put forward
by Einstein…
PAUL, spoofs an old song called ‘Any old iron'
Any old Ein, any old Ein, any, any, any old Einstein.
JOHN
… could well be applied here. The people in the ball are obviously extensions of our
own personalities, suspended, as it were, in time, frozen in space, according to the
now famous Theory of Relativity, which, briefly explained, is simply a matter of taking
two eggs...
The other three try to break the ball.
PAUL
John!
JOHN
… beating lightly and adding a little salt and pepper...
GEORGE
John!
JOHN
George?
GEORGE
How do we get them out?
JOHN
Break the gla**.
GEORGE
We can't. It's Beatle-proof.
JOHN
Nothing is Beatle-proof.
PAUL, to Ringo
Have you got your drumsticks with you? A drum break might shatter it.
RINGO
No, I haven't.
Page 45
GEORGE
Have a look in your pocket.
1:15:50 “Baby you're a rich man” is heard.
RINGO
I've got a hole in my pocket. I wonder if...
Ringo sticks the hole on the ball. The ball gets empty.
RINGO
Yeah, it still works.
GEORGE
We take back all we said.
JOHN
You're a genius.
PAUL
A sheer genius.
RINGO
I know, I know, I know. [Some colors get out of the ball] Like coloured telly.
GEORGE
Like crystal.
PAUL
They're decanting.
The members of the Band face their peers.
RINGO 2
Hello, brother.
RINGO
Yeah, without a doubt.
GEORGE
We're the spitting image of each other.
GEORGE 2
Golly, yeah.
JOHN
I'm led to believe that you're an extension of my personality.
JOHN 2
Yes, I'm your alter-ego man.
Page 46
JOHN
And I'm the ego man, goo goo, g'joob. [They walk together] I'm glad you asked me
that. Because as a matter of fact there's a war on. Then, brothers in war, to the
skirmish must we hence.
JOHN 2
Shall we hence?
PAUL
Let's not waste time sitting on the hence. Beatles to battle. Charge!
The Blue Meanies attack again. The Beatles run for a hide.
JOHN
We're surrounded.
RINGO, pointing the four-headed dog
Nice dog, though.
The Beatles hide inside a hurdy-gurdy. John turns the crank and sings:
1:17:26 THE BEATLES : HEY BULLDOG
Sheepdog... standing in the rain
Bullfrog... doing it again
Some kind of happiness
is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're
something special when you smile?
Childlike... no one understands
Jack knife... in your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence
is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like
to listen to your fears
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me
Big man... walking in the park
Wigwam... frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude
is measured out in you
You think you know me
but you haven't got a clue
You can talk to me,
You can talk to me
You can talk to me...
if you're lonely you can talk to me
Hey, bulldog (x4)
Page 47
John to the dog:
What do you say? Sing it.
Do you know any more? Play it!
Todos
Hey, bulldog.
The Beatles escape from the dog and the guards. Ringo finds Jeremy hanging from
the branch of a tree.
RINGO
Jeremy, can it be you?
JEREMY
Can it be me? I think you'd better
inquire of the guards,
for when I was captured,
they took all my cards.
RINGO
Shh, that's enough, Jeremy. Come on, the whole world's being attacked.
JEREMY
What do you want me to do?
Do you recommend fisticuffs
versus the guard?
[With a fighting manual in his hand Jeremy challenges the guard ]
Oh, guard! Blue Meanio!
Left to the nostril, right uppercut,
right to the eyebrow, left to the gut.
Jeremy stumbles into a tree. An apple falls down and knocks out the meanie. Ringo
congratulates Jeremy.
RINGO
Jeremy!
JEREMY
Come on, Ringo!
The Chief treats to stem the rout.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Get back! Get back! Once more unto the breach, dear Meanies! You're advancing
the wrong way! Retreat backwards! Get back there now!
The Chief is swept along.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
My kingdom for a horse! [Jeremy comes close to him] I think I'll tear him up into little
pieces.
Page 48
JEREMY
He does, does he?
CHIEF
I think I'll make a blueburger out of him.
JEREMY
Ha-ha, I don't care what you think.
CHIEF
You don't, eh? We'll soon see about that.
JEREMY
He does in truth seem quite annoyed,
[Opens the manual]
some reference material
before I'm destroyed.
Where ground is soft most often grows,
Arise, arise, arouse, a rose.
[Suddenly, a rose arise in the Chief nose]
A rosy nose?
CHIEF
Speak your last piece!
JEREMY
Peace, peace,
supplant the doom and the gloom.
Turn off what is sour,
turn into a flower and bloom, bloom.
Ha-ha, bloom, ha-ha, bloom,
bloom, bloom...
A lot of pink roses cover the whole body of the Chief. He flees crazy.
RINGO
First time I saw that Nowhere Man, that nobody, I knew he was somebody.
JOHN
You're right. Hello there, blue people. Won't you join us? Buck up, and otherwise go
mingle. What do you say?
CHIEF
Max?
MAX
Your Blue... I mean your Newness!
CHIEF, takes some flowers
It's no longer a blue world, Max. Where could we go?
Page 49
MAX
Argentina?
JOHN
Are you with us? Will you join?
CHIEF
Shall we?
MAX
No!... [Chief threatens to hit him] Yes, your Newness!
CHIEF, smiles
Yes, Max...
JEREMY, close to them
Yes. Oh, yes is a word with a glorious ring,
A true, universal, euphonious thing.
In genders embracing
and chasing of blues,
the very best word
for the whole world to use. Ha-ha!
CHIEF
Yes, let us mix, Max. I've never admitted it before, but my cousin is the Bluebird of
Happiness.
1:24:41 THE BEATLES : IT'S ALL TOO MUCH
It's all too much
When I look into your eyes,
Your love is there for me
And the more I go inside,
the more there is to see
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake,
So take a piece but not too much
Everybody dance. Jeremy and the Chief reconcile. The Chief cries of
emotion.
Nice to have the time
to take this opportunity
Time for me to look at you,
and you to look at me
It's all too much for me to see
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much
It's too much

PAUL
Catchy tune, that.
RINGO
I can't seem to get it out of my head.
GEORGE
Then shake it.
RINGO
That's what we've been doing all night.
PAUL
Yeah, it was a great party.
GEORGE
And we brought back lots of lovely souvenirs. Here is the motor.
PAUL
I've got a little love.
RINGO
And I've got a hole in my pocket.
PAUL
A hole?
RINGO
Half a hole, anyway. I gave the rest to Jeremy.
GEORGE
What can he do with half a hole?
PAUL
Fix it to keep his mind from wandering.
RINGO
Look at John, will you?
John has been looping through a telescope.
PAUL
What's the matter, John? Blue Meanies?
JOHN
Newer and bluer Meanies have been sighted within the vicinity of this theatre.
There's only one way to go out.
GEORGE
How's that?

1:28:42 CREDITS
In the town where i was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine
We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
And our friends are all on board
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play
We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine



We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
As we live a life of ease
Everyone of us has all we need
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our yellow submarine.
We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

[Instrumental]

Yes, I'm lonely
Wanna die

Wanna die
If I ain't dead already, whoo
Girl, you know the reason why
In the morning
Wanna die
In the evening
Wanna die
If I ain't dead already, whoo
Girl, you know the reason why
My mother was of the sky
My father was of the Earth
But I am of the Universe
And you know what it's worth
I'm lonely
Wanna die
If I ain't dead already, whoo
Girl, you know the reason why
The eagle picks my eyes
The worm he licks my bone
Feel so suicidal 



Just like Dylan's Mr. Jone
Lonely
Wanna die
If I ain't dead already, whoo
Girl, you know the reason why
The black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist 'round my soul
Feel so suicidal
Even hate my rock and roll
Wanna die
Yeah, wanna die
If I ain't dead already, whoo
Girl, you know the reason why
(Turn it up)
Yes, I'm lonely

If i ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why.
In the morning wanna die
In the evening wanna die
If i ain't dead already

My mother was of the sky
My father was of the earth
But i am of the universe
And you know what it's worth
I'm lonely wanna die
If i ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why.



The eagle picks my eye
The worm he licks my bone
I feel so suicidal
Just like dylan's mr. jones

Black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist round my soul
Feel so suicidal
Even hate my rock and roll
Wanna die yeah wanna die
If i ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why.

Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away

Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me.

Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say
Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away



How can I even try?
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
"Love will find a way?"
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say
Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away
I got something to say
That might cause you pain
If I catch you talking
To that boy again
I'm gonna let you down
And leave you flat
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that
Well, it's the second time
I've caught you talking to him
Do I have to tell you one more time
I think it's a sin?
I think I'll let you down (Let you down)
And leave you flat (Gonna let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that
Everybody's green
'Cos I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face
So, please listen to me
If you want to stay mine 



I can't help my feelings
I'd go out of my mind
I'm gonna let you down (Let you down)
And leave you flat (Gonna let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that
You can't do that
Everybody's green
'Cos I'm the one who won your love

Gonna let you down and leave you flat,
Because i've told you before, oh,



You can't do that.
Ev'rybody's green,
'cause i'm the one, who won your love,
But if it's seen,
You're talking that way they'd laugh in my face.
So please listen to me, if you wanna stay mine,
I can't help my feelings, i'll go out of my mind.
I know i'll let you down,
And leave you flat,

You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations you break down
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation I break down
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go



But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go, nowhere to go...
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today, came true today (yes it did)
One two three four five six seven
All good children go to Heaven...

[Verse 1]
I saw her standing on the corner (Yip yip boom)
A yellow ribbon in her hair (Yip yip boom)
I couldn't stop myself from calling
Well look a-there, look a-there
Wow look a-there, well look a-there
Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
[Verse 2]
I took one look and I was fractured (Yip yip boom)
I tried to walk but I was lame (Yip yip boom)
I tried to talk but I just stuttered
Well what's your name, what's your name
Well what's your name, well what's your name
Young blood, ah young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind



[Verse 3]
A crazy stop, she was the top
I tried to follow her all the way home
Things went bad, I met her dad
He said, "You'd better leave my daughter alone"
Ow!
[Verse 4]
Well I tried to speak but I just stuttered (Yip yip boom)
I saw the rising of the sun (Yip yip boom)
And all along my heart was falling
While you're the one, you're the one
While you're the one, ah you're the one
Young blood, oh young blood, yeah young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
Yeah young blood, oh young blood, yeah young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
i saw her standing on the corner
A yellow ribbon in her hair
I couldn't keep myself from shouting
Look - a - there
Look - a - there
Look - a - there
Look - a - there
Young blood
Young blood
Young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
I took one look and i was fractured
I tried to walk but i was lame
I tried to talk but i just stuttered
What's your name
What's your name
What's your name



What's your name
Young blood etc.
What crazy stuff
She looked so tough
I had to follow her all the way home
Then things went bad
I met her dad
He said
You better leave my daughter alone
I couldn't sleep a wink for trying
I saw the rising of the sun
And all night long my heart was crying
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one
Young blood etc. (twice)
